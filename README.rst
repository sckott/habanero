This is a low level client for working with Crossref's search API. It's been named to be more generic, as other organizations are/will adopt Crossref's search API, making it possible to interact with all from one client.

`Crossref API docs <https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc>`__

Other Crossref API clients:

- Ruby: `serrano`, `<https://github.com/sckott/serrano>`__

Crossref's API issue tracker: https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues

`habanero` includes three modules you can import as needed (or
import all):

`Crossref` - Crossref search API. The `Crossref` module includes methods matching Crossref API routes, and a few convenience methods for getting DOI agency and random DOIs:

- `works` - `/works` route
- `members` - `/members` route
- `prefixes` - `/prefixes` route
- `funders` - `/funders` route
- `journals` - `/journals` route
- `types` - `/types` route
- `licenses` - `/licenses` route
- `registration_agency` - get DOI minting agency
- `random_dois` - get random set of DOIs

`counts` - citation counts. Includes the single `citation_count` method

`cn` - content negotiation. Includes the methods:

- `content_negotiation` - get citations in a variety of formats
- `csl_styles` - get CSL styles, used in `content_negotation` method

`WorksContainer` - A class for handling Crossref works. Pass output of works from methods on the `Crossref` class to more easily extract specific fields of works. 

Note about searching:

You are using the Crossref search API described at https://api.crossref.org/swagger-ui/index.html. When you search with query terms, on Crossref servers they are not searching full text, or even abstracts of articles, but only what is available in the data that is returned to you. That is, they search article titles, authors, etc. For some discussion on this, see https://gitlab.com/crossref/issues/-/issues/101

Rate limits
-----------

See the headers `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` and `X-Rate-Limit-Interval` for current rate limits.

The Polite Pool
---------------

To get in the polite pool it's a good idea now to include a `mailto` email
address. See docs for more information.
