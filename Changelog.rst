Changelog
=========

2.2.0 (2025-02-04)
--------------------
* Make tests independent of optional dependency `bibtexparser` (#199) thanks @hseg !

2.0.0 (2024-11-25)
--------------------
* Now using `uv` to manage work on this package. See `Makefile` and GH Actions files for how it's used (#195)
* Moved `bibtexparser` from required dependency to optional, install with `pip install habanero[bibtex]` (#185)

1.2.6 (2024-02-03)
--------------------
* mark two more tests for vcr to create cassettes for (both content_negotation tests) - no user facing changes (#114)
* habanero now conditionally uses bibtexparser to roundtrip bibtex to attempt to fix any bibtex that's not formatted correctly (#144) (#153)

1.2.3 (2023-02-02)
--------------------
* now using typehints, tested on Python back to 3.6; though could work with older Python 3 versions. See the new docs for better information on types (#70)
* fixed problem with usage of `warn=True`; in a for loop, an internal variable `warning_thrown` wasn't being reset after each loop iteration, with the result that all objects returned after a warning was thrown were `None` regardless of the actual result. sorry about that!  (#112) (#113)

1.2.2 (2022-05-19)
--------------------
* Fixed class `WorksContainer` to work with cursor output of works results (e.g., `cr.works(query, cursor="*")`) (#106) thanks @IvanSterligov

1.2 (2022-03-27)
--------------------
* Added class `WorksContainer` to make handling works data easier (#101)
* changed master branch to main in github development repository (#103)

* fail better when json is not returned; try json.loads and catch ValueError (JSONDecodeError is a subclass of ValueError) (#97)
* funders, journals, members, prefixes, types and works gain `warn` parameter to optionally throw a warning instead of error if a DOI is not found - not found DOI with `warn=True` returns `None` (#69)

0.7.4 (2020-05-29)
--------------------

* use of a progress bar is now possible when fetching works route data, only when doing deep paging, see `progress_bar` parameter (#77) (#82)

* no longer testing under Python 2

* Added to docs a bit about rate limiting, their current values, that they can change, and how to show them in verbose curl responses (#45)
