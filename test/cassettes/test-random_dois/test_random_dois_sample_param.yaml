      wellness tourism motivation (WTM) on tourist satisfaction (TS) and tourist experience
      (TE), while also examining the mediating role of TE in the relationship between
      WTM and TS in the context of luxury spa resorts situated in the Himalayan regions
      of India. Drawing on an extensive review of the literature, this study proposes
      a conceptual model that hypothesizes the influence of WTM on TS and TE, as well
      as the impact of TE on TS. Data were collected through 260 questionnaires distributed
      to tourists visiting prominent spa resorts to validate the proposed model empirically.
      Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships
      between the constructs. The results revealed that wellness tourism motivations
      have a positive impact on both TS and TE. Additionally, TE serves as a mediator,
      further enhancing the connection between WTM and TS. This study contributes
      to the growing body of literature on wellness tourism by providing empirical
      evidence on the unique dynamics of WTM, TE, and TS in Himalayan spa resorts,
      which cater to a distinct segment of wellness tourists. The results offer valuable
      insights for tourism operators and policymakers, enabling them to design tailored
      wellness experiences that enhance customer satisfaction and meet the specific
      needs of wellness-focused travelers. This research underscores the importance
      of prioritizing tourist experiences as a strategic tool for fostering satisfaction
      and loyalty in the luxury wellness tourism sector.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/tourhosp6020118","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,17]],"date-time":"2025-06-17T09:52:47Z","timestamp":1750153967000},"page":"118","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Wellness
