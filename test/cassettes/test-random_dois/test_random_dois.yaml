        Cancer treatment is increasingly dependent on biomarkers for prognostication
        and treatment selection. Potential biomarkers are frequently evaluated in
        prospective-retrospective studies in which biomarkers are measured retrospectively
        on archived specimens after completion of prospective clinical trials. In
        light of the high costs of some assays, random sampling designs have been
        proposed that measure biomarkers for a random sub-sample of subjects selected
        on the basis of observed outcome and possibly other variables. Compared with
        a standard design that measures biomarkers on all subjects, a random sampling
        design can be cost-efficient in the sense of reducing the cost of the study
        substantially while achieving a reasonable level of precision.<jats:italic>Methods:<\/jats:italic>
        For a biomarker that indicates the presence of some molecular alteration (e.g.,
        mutation in a gene), we explore the use of a group testing strategy, which
        involves physically pooling specimens across subjects and assaying pooled
        samples for the presence of the molecular alteration of interest, for further
        improvement in cost-efficiency beyond random sampling. We propose simple and
        general approaches to estimating the prognostic and predictive values of biomarkers
        with group testing, and conduct simulation studies to validate the proposed
        estimation procedures and to assess the cost-efficiency of the group testing
        design in comparison to the standard and random sampling designs.<jats:italic>Results:<\/jats:italic><jats:bold>
        <\/jats:bold>Simulation results show that the proposed estimation procedures
        perform well in realistic settings and that a group testing design can have
        considerably higher cost-efficiency than a random sampling design. <jats:italic>Conclusions:
        <\/jats:italic>Group testing can be used to improve the cost-efficiency of
        biomarker studies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-51687\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,27]],"date-time":"2020-08-27T15:09:04Z","timestamp":1598540944000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Group
