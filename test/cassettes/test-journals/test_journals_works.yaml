        biomes in South America are likely to experience a persistent increase in
        environmental temperature, possibly combined with moisture reduction due to
        climate change. In addition, natural fire ignition sources, such as lightning,
        can become more frequent under climate change scenarios since favourable environmental
        conditions are likely to occur more often. In this sense, changes in the frequency
        and magnitude of natural fires can impose novel stressors on different ecosystems
        according to their adaptation to fires. By focusing on Brazilian biomes, we
        use an innovative combination of techniques to quantify fire persistence and
        occurrence patterns over time and evaluate climate risk by considering key
        fire-related climatic characteristics. Then, we tested four major hypotheses
        considering the overall characteristics of fire-dependent, fire-independent,
        and fire-sensitive biomes concerning (1) fire persistence over time; (2) the
        relationship between climate and fire occurrence; (3) future predictions of
        climate change and its potential impacts on fire occurrence; and (4) climate
        risk faced by biomes.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
        performed a Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to test whether fires in Brazilian
        biomes are persistent over time. We considered four bioclimatic variables
        whose links to fire frequency and intensity are well-established to assess
        the relationship between climate and fire occurrence by confronting these
        climate predictors with a fire occurrence dataset through correlative models.
        To assess climate risk, we calculated the climate hazard, sensitivity, resilience,
        and vulnerability of Brazilian biomes, and then we multiplied the Biomes\u2019
        vulnerability index by the hazards.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Our
        results indicate a persistent behaviour of fires in all Brazilian biomes at
        almost the same rates, which could represent human-induced patterns of fire
        persistence. We also corroborated our second hypothesis by showing that most
        fire-dependent biomes presented high thermal suitability to fire, while the
        fire-independent biome presented intermediate suitability and fire-sensitive
        biomes are the least suitable for fire occurrence. The third hypothesis was
        partially corroborated since fire-dependent and independent biomes are likely
        to increase their thermal suitability to fire, while fire-sensitive biomes
        are likely to present stable-to-decreasing thermal suitability in the future.
        Finally, our fourth hypothesis was partially corroborated since most fire-dependent
        biomes presented low climate risk, while the fire-independent biome presented
        a high risk and the fire-sensitive biomes presented opposite trends. In summary,
        while the patterns of fire persistence and fire occurrence over time are more
        likely to be related to human-induced fires, key drivers of burned areas are
        likely to be intensified across Brazilian biomes in the future, potentially
        increasing the magnitude of the fires and harming the biomes\u2019 integrity.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14276","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,25]],"date-time":"2022-10-25T07:34:21Z","timestamp":1666683261000},"page":"e14276","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["We\u2019re

        in China. Typhlocybinae, second largest subfamilies of Cicadellidae, is widely
        distributed in the six major zoogeographic regions of the world, including
        &gt;4,000 species worldwide and &gt;1,000 species in China. Previously, morphological
        analysis are often effective to the way of taxonomy, but it did not combine
        with molecular biology. Therefore, morphology and mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes)

        basal triangles of scutellum, and forewing are dark with several colorless

        shoots, rhizome length, and the number of buds, rhizomes and offspring shoots
        in the flooded treatment were significantly greater than those in the drought
        treatment. Our results indicated that the tolerance strategies used by reeds,
        including higher biomass accumulation and photosynthesis in offspring shoots,
        low allocation of Pb in rhizomes and offspring shoots, and stable clonal growth,
        maintained the stability of population propagation and productivity, improving
        the resistance of reeds to Pb pollution in flood environment. However, the
        resistance or tolerance was significantly reduced by the synergistic effect
        of Pb and drought, which significantly inhibited biomass accumulation, photosynthesis,
        and clonal growth of reeds.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4188","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,3]],"date-time":"2018-01-03T09:21:28Z","timestamp":1514971288000},"page":"e4188","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Resistance

        chiriqhucha<\/jats:italic>str. N139 genome contains one chromosome and three
        megaplasmids. The genome analysis of the Andean strain suggests the presence

        the ability to grow under multiple environmental extreme conditions, including
        high concentrations of different metals, high ultraviolet B radiation, scavenging
        for phosphorous and coping with high salinity. Moreover, the regulation of
        its tryptophan biosynthesis suggests that novel pathways remain to be discovered,
        and that these pathways might be fundamental in the amino acid metabolism
        of the microbial community from Laguna Negra, Argentina.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3162","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,19]],"date-time":"2017-04-19T08:09:08Z","timestamp":1492589348000},"page":"e3162","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["The

        limestone karst area of South China is a major biodiversity hotspot of global

        two unknown species of Gesneriaceae were collected. After conducting a comprehensive

        on the shape of the leaf and flower, but it can be easily distinguished by
        the shape of the bracts, corolla and stigma, indumentum of peduncles, pedicels

        stamens in the corolla tube. Considering that not enough is known about their

        of male-male courtship display is widespread across the animal kingdom. Yet,
        its function and evolutionary origin remain unclear. Here, we hypothesise
        that male-male courtship display evolved in response to selection pressure
        exerted by intrasexual competition during male-female courtship interactions.
        Intrasexual competition can be caused by bystander male pressure through eavesdropping
        and exploiting on displayer male\u2019s courtship interactions with females.
        This bystander pressure can lead to an audience effect by the displayer, who
        will change their courtship behaviour in the presence of bystanders and display
        directly towards them, even in the absence of females, as an intimidation
        strategy. In species where this selection pressure has taken place, we predict
        that the male courtship display will have a dual function: attract females
        and deter competitors. Therefore, we expected to find more evidence of bystander-related
        behaviours in species for which male-male courtship display is linked to intrasexual
        competition compared to species for which other explanatory hypotheses are
        more plausible (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., mistaken identity or courtship
        practice).<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methodology<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>We
        conducted two systematic reviews to test this hypothesis. First, we conducted
        a search for studies of species with courtship display between males and of
        the hypotheses provided to explain this behaviour. Our goal was to identify
        the species with male-male courtship display and evidence of intrasexual competition.
        Second, among the species with male-male courtship display, we searched for
        evidence of bystander-related behaviours, <jats:italic>i.e<\/jats:italic>.,
        articles referring to eavesdropping, exploitation, and audience effect during
        male-female courtship interactions. Our goal was to test whether species with
        intrasexual competition are also more likely to show bystander-related behaviours.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Although
        most studies reporting male courtship display towards other males do not suggest
        any explanatory hypothesis for this behaviour, the intrasexual competition
        hypothesis was largely mentioned and supported by some studies reviewed. Additionally,
        there is more evidence of eavesdropping and of all three bystander-related
        behaviours combined in species for which the intrasexual competition hypothesis
        was suggested.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Overall,
        our review supports the hypothesis that intrasexual competition can play a
        key role in male courtship display evolution, namely that male-male courtship
        display may have evolved as a secondary function of male-female courtship
        interactions <jats:italic>via<\/jats:italic> bystander male pressure. However,
        our review also shows that despite the increasing interest in same-sex sexual
        behaviours, and male-male courtship display in particular, most studies were
        found to be merely descriptive, and the hypotheses they suggested to explain
        courtship display between males mostly speculative. This highlights an important
        gap in the literature. To clarify both the evolution and the function of male-male
        courtship display, this behaviour needs to be empirically studied more often.
        Our review can help advancing this research area, as it makes the 20 species
        with male-male courtship display for which the intrasexual competition hypothesis
        was suggested excellent candidates for empirical research.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14638","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]],"date-time":"2023-02-02T09:35:54Z","timestamp":1675330554000},"page":"e14638","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["The

        is one of the most frequently occurring stressors confronted by industrial
        cultures of sea cucumber and can cause large economic losses and resource
        degradation. However, its responsive mechanisms are still lacking. In this
        paper, the physiological responses of <jats:italic>Apostichopus japonicus<\/jats:italic>
        to oxygen deficiency was illustrated, including induced oxidative response
        and immune defense and changed digestive enzymes activities. Significantly
        increased activities of alpha-amylase (AMS), acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate
        dehydrogenase, catalase, peroxidase, succinate dehydrogenase and higher content
        of malondialdehyde, and decreased activities of lipase and trypsin (TRY) were
        observed after hypoxia exposure (dissolved oxygen [DO] 2 mg\/L). Expressions
        of key genes showed that <jats:italic>AMS, peptidase, ACP, alkaline phosphatase,
        lysozyme, heat shock protein 70<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>glutathione
        peroxidase<\/jats:italic> were increased and <jats:italic>TRY<\/jats:italic>
        was decreased under hypoxia. With the decline of the DO level, the decreased
        tendency of oxygen consumption rates was different in varied weight groups.
        Moreover, respiratory trees were observed degraded under long-term hypoxia
        stress, thus leading a negative effect of respiration. These results could
        help to develop a better understanding of the responsive mechanism of sea
        cucumber under hypoxia stress and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention
        of hypoxia risk.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4651","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,27]],"date-time":"2018-04-27T08:43:11Z","timestamp":1524818591000},"page":"e4651","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":53,"title":["Impact

        interaction between plants and frugivores is crucial to ecosystem function
        and community diversity. However, little is known about the interaction between
        plants and frugivorous bird species in urban green spaces. We observed interactions
        between plants and frugivorous birds in the Guilin Botanical Garden for one
        year and determined the structure and characteristics of the interaction network.
        We also analyzed the impact of species traits on their network roles. Interactions
        between 14 frugivorous birds and 13 fruit plant species were recorded in the
        study area. Autumn interactions comprised 38.79% of the overall network, and
        winter interactions comprised 33.15%. The modularity (<jats:italic>Q<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network was higher in autumn;

        <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network was higher in summer.
        The observed network showed lower <jats:italic>C<\/jats:italic>, lower interaction
        <jats:italic>H<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>, lower <jats:italic>E<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>
        , lower <jats:italic>wNODF<\/jats:italic>, higher <jats:italic>H<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\u2032<\/jats:italic>
        and higher <jats:italic>Q<\/jats:italic> when compared to the random networks.
        The bird species most important to network stability were <jats:italic>Hemixos
        castanonotus<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Parus venustulus<\/jats:italic>,
        and <jats:italic>Pycnonotus sinensis<\/jats:italic>. The most important plant
        species were <jats:italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cinnamomum
        camphora<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Machilus nanmu<\/jats:italic>. Of
        all the bird and plant traits included in this study, only plant color had
        a significant impact on species strength, with black fruit having a higher
        species strength. Our results suggest that interaction networks in urban green
        spaces can be temporally complex and variable and that a network approach
        can be an important monitoring tool for detecting the status of crucial ecosystem
        functions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15028","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,16]],"date-time":"2023-03-16T09:41:28Z","timestamp":1678959688000},"page":"e15028","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Structure

        of winter wheat yield under dryland conditions depends on improving soil water
        stored during fallow and its efficient use. A 3-year field experiment was
        conducted in Loess Plateau to access the effect of tillage and N (nitrogen)
        rates on soil water, N distribution and water- and nitrogen-use efficiency
        of winter wheat. Deep tillage (DT, 25\u201330 cm depth) and no-tillage (NT)
        were operated during fallow season, whereas four N rates (0, 90, 150 and 210
        kg ha<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>) were applied before sowing. Rates of N
        and variable rainfall during summer fallow period led to the difference of
        soil water storage. Soil water storage at anthesis and maturity was decreased
        with increasing N rate especially in the year with high precipitation (2014\u20132015).
        DT has increased the soil water storage at sowing, N content, numbers of spike,
        grain number, 1,000 grain weight, grain yield, and water and N use efficiency
        as compared to NT. Grain yield was significantly and positively related to
        soil water consumption at sowing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity, total
        plant N, and water-use efficiency. Our study implies that optimum N rate and
        deep tillage during the fallow season could improve dryland wheat production
        by balancing the water consumption and biomass production.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8892","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]],"date-time":"2020-04-30T08:37:42Z","timestamp":1588235862000},"page":"e8892","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Soil

        bar-headed goose (<jats:italic>Anser indicus<\/jats:italic>) mainly inhabits
        the plateau wetlands of Asia. As a specialized high-altitude species, bar-headed
        geese can migrate between South and Central Asia and annually fly twice over
        the Himalayan mountains along the central Asian flyway. The physiological,
        biochemical and behavioral adaptations of bar-headed geese to high-altitude
        living and flying have raised much interest. However, to date, there is still
        no genome assembly information publicly available for bar-headed geese.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In

        Genomics sequencing produced a total of 124 Gb sequencing data, which can
        cover the estimated genome size of bar-headed goose for 103 times (average
        coverage). The genome assembly comprised 10,528 scaffolds, with a total length
        of 1.143 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 10.09 Mb. Annotation of the bar-headed goose
        genome assembly identified a total of 102 Mb (8.9%) of repetitive sequences,
        16,428 protein-coding genes, and 282 tRNAs. In total, we determined that there
        were 63 expanded and 20 contracted gene families in the bar-headed goose compared
        with the other 15 vertebrates. We also performed a positive selection analysis
        between the bar-headed goose and the closely related low-altitude goose, swan
        goose (<jats:italic>Anser cygnoides<\/jats:italic>), to uncover its genetic
        adaptations to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title><jats:p>We

        Our assembly will provide a valuable resource to enhance further studies of
        the gene functions of bar-headed goose. The data will also be valuable for
        facilitating studies of the evolution, population genetics and high-altitude
        adaptations of the bar-headed geese at the genomic level.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8914","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,6]],"date-time":"2020-04-06T07:18:58Z","timestamp":1586157538000},"page":"e8914","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["First

        surveys conducted on Reunion Island coral reefs revealed an atypical manifestation
        of black band disease on the main framework building coral, Porites lutea.
        This BBD manifestation (PorBBD) presented a thick lighter-colored band, which
        preceded the typical BBD lesion. Whilst BBD aetiology has been intensively
        described worldwide, it remains unclear if corals with apparently similar
        lesions across coral reefs are affected by the same pathogens. Therefore,
        a multidisciplinary approach involving field surveys, gross lesion monitoring,
        histopathology and 454-pyrosequencing was employed to provide the first comprehensive
        characterization of this particular manifestation. Surveys conducted within
        two geomorphological zones over two consecutive summers and winters showed
        spatial and seasonal patterns consistent with those found for typical BBD.
        Genetic analyses suggested an uncharacteristically high level of Vibrio spp.
        bacterial infection within PorBBD. However, microscopic analysis revealed
        high densities of cyanobacteria, penetrating the compromised tissue as well
        as the presence of basophilic bodies resembling bacterial aggregates in the
        living tissue, adjacent to the bacterial mat. Additionally, classical BBD-associated
        cyanobacterial strains, genetically related to Pseudoscillatoria coralii and
        Roseofilum reptotaenium were identified and isolated and the presence of sulfate-reducers
        or sulfide-oxidizers such as Desulfovibrio and Arcobacter, previously shown
        to be associated with anoxic microenvironment within typical BBD was also
        observed, confirming that PorBBD is a manifestation of classical BBD.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2073","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,6]],"date-time":"2016-07-06T07:53:42Z","timestamp":1467791622000},"page":"e2073","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["Characterisation

        sequences of marine streptomycetes are valuable for the discovery of useful
        enzymes and bioactive compounds by genome mining. However, publicly available
        complete genome sequences of marine streptomycetes are still limited. Here,
        we present the complete genome sequence of a marine streptomycete<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
        S063 CGMCC 14582. Species delineation based on the pairwise digital DNA-DNA
        hybridization and genome comparison ANI (average nucleotide identity) value
        showed that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063 CGMCC 14582 possesses
        a unique genome that is clearly different from all of the other available
        genomes. Bioactivity tests showed that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
        S063 CGMCC 14582 produces metabolites with anti-complement activities, which
        are useful for treatment of numerous diseases that arise from inappropriate
        activation of the human complement system. Analysis of the genome reveals
        no biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) which shows even low similarity to that
        of the known anti-complement agents was detected in the genome, indicating
        that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063 CGMCC 14582 may produce
        novel anti-complement agents of microbial origin. Four BGCs which are potentially
        involved in biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides were disrupted, but no
        decrease of anti-complement activities was observed, suggesting that these
        four BGCs are not involved in biosynthesis of the anti-complement agents.
        In addition, LC-MS\/MS analysis and subsequent alignment through the Global
        Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform led to the detection
        of novel peptides produced by the strain.<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
        S063 CGMCC 14582 grows rapidly and is salt tolerant, which benefits efficient
        secondary metabolite production via seawater-based fermentation. Our results
        indicate that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063 has great potential
        to produce novel bioactive compounds, and also is a good host for heterologous
        production of useful secondary metabolites for drug discovery.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6122","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,3]],"date-time":"2019-01-03T09:46:08Z","timestamp":1546508768000},"page":"e6122","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Analysis

        found that warming increased the mean seed mass of 4 (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a019)
        species in the LG meadow and 6 (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a020)
        species in the HG meadow, while decreasing the mean seed mass of 6 species
        in the LG and HG meadows, respectively. For 7 species, grazing history modified
        the effect of warming on seed mass. Therefore, we concluded that long-term
        warming can shift the mean seed mass at the species level. However, the direction
        of this variation is species-specific. Our study suggests that mean seed mass
        of alpine plant species appears to decrease in warmer (less stressful) habitats
        based on life-history theory, but it also suggests there may be an underlying
        trade-off in which mean seed mass may increase due to greater thermal energy
        inputs into seed development. Furthermore, the physical and biotic environment
        modulating this trade-off result in complex patterns of variation in mean
        seed mass of alpine plant species facing global warming.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7416","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]],"date-time":"2019-07-31T07:18:12Z","timestamp":1564557492000},"page":"e7416","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Long-term

        use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis
        of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad
        range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex
        model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not
        always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference
        requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here,
        we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs
        to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered
        in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods
        of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory
        and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct
        the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those
        seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible
        code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and
        model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn
        from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4794","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,23]],"date-time":"2018-05-23T04:55:29Z","timestamp":1527051329000},"page":"e4794","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1162,"title":["A

        use of baited remote underwater video (BRUV) for examining and monitoring
        marine biodiversity in temperate marine environments is rapidly growing, however
        many aspects of their effectiveness relies on assumptions based on studies
        from the Southern Hemisphere. The addition of bait to underwater camera systems
        acts as a stimulus for attracting individuals towards the camera field of
        view, however knowledge of the effectiveness of different bait types in northern
        temperate climbs is limited, particularly in dynamic coastal environments.
        Studies in the Southern Hemisphere indicate that oily baits are most effective
        whilst bait volume and weight do not impact BRUV effectiveness to any great
        degree. The present study assesses the influence of four bait types (mackerel,
        squid, crab and no bait (control)) on the relative abundance, taxonomic diversity
        and faunal assemblage composition at two independent locations within the
        North-Eastern Atlantic region; Swansea Bay, UK and Ria Formosa Lagoon, Portugal.
        Two different bait quantities (50 g and 350 g) were further trialled in Swansea
        Bay. Overall, patterns showed that baited deployments recorded statistically
        higher values of relative abundance and taxonomic diversity when compared
        to un-baited deployments in Swansea Bay but not in Ria Formosa Lagoon. No
        statistical evidence singled out one bait type as best performing for attracting
        higher abundances and taxonomic diversity in both locations. Faunal assemblage
        composition was however found to differ with bait type in Swansea Bay, with
        mackerel and squid attracting higher abundances of scavenging species compared
        to the crab and control treatments. With the exception of squid, bait quantity
        had minimal influence on bait attractiveness. It is recommended for consistency
        that a minimum of 50 g of cheap, oily fish such as mackerel is used as bait
        for BRUV deployments in shallow dynamic coastal environments in the North-Eastern
        Atlantic Region.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.9744","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,27]],"date-time":"2020-08-27T08:59:37Z","timestamp":1598518777000},"page":"e9744","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["The

        researchers dominate scientific production in science, technology, engineering,
        and mathematics (STEM). However, potential mechanisms to avoid this gender
        imbalance remain poorly explored in STEM, including ecology and evolution
        areas. In the last decades, changes in the peer-review process towards double-anonymized
        (DA) have increased among ecology and evolution (EcoEvo) journals. Using comprehensive
        data on articles from 18 selected EcoEvo journals with an impact factor &gt;1,
        we tested the effect of the DA peer-review process in female-leading (<jats:italic>i.e<\/jats:italic>.,
        first and senior authors) articles. We tested whether the representation of
        female-leading authors differs between double and single-anonymized (SA) peer-reviewed
        journals. Also, we tested if the adoption of the DA by previous SA journals
        has increased the representativeness of female-leading authors over time.
        We found that publications led by female authors did not differ between DA
        and SA journals. Moreover, female-leading articles did not increase after
        changes from SA to DA peer-review. Tackling female underrepresentation in
        science is a complex task requiring many interventions. Still, our results
        highlight that adopting the DA peer-review system alone could be insufficient
        in fostering gender equality in EcoEvo scientific publications. Ecologists
        and evolutionists understand how diversity is important to ecosystems\u2019
        resilience in facing environmental changes. The question remaining is: why
        is it so difficult to promote and keep this \u201cdiversity\u201d in addition
        to equity and inclusion in the academic environment? We thus argue that all
        scientists, mentors, and research centers must be engaged in promoting solutions
        to gender bias by fostering diversity, inclusion, and affirmative measures.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15186","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,10]],"date-time":"2023-04-10T07:19:30Z","timestamp":1681111170000},"page":"e15186","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Overcoming

        is an edible commercial sequestrate genus that is globally distributed. From
        the five described taxa of this genus, <jats:italic>Mattirolomyces terfezioides<\/jats:italic>
        is the most common species in Asia. Our recent attempts to locate <jats:italic>M.
        terfezioides<\/jats:italic> outside its current distribution area in China
        documented its first records in areas of poplar trees with the lowest known
        temperature and precipitation averages ever recorded for this species. This
        peculiar ecology was not reflected on the species-morphological features nor
        on its phylogenetic position in the genus. The first attempt to apply the
        phylogenetic network approach to <jats:italic>Mattirolomyces<\/jats:italic>
        revealed its geographic origin in the Asian-Pacific areas prior to frequent
        long-distance migration events. Based on data from recent study areas, we
        found that the collections from Inner Mongolia and the Shanxi province were
        similar to European collections. Asian haplotypes were less distant from the
        outgroup comparing to collections from Europe, supporting the hypothesis that
        <jats:italic>M. terfezioides<\/jats:italic> was originated from this Chinese
        area and was subsequently transported to Europe. Exploring <jats:italic>M.
        terfezioides<\/jats:italic> ecology and its mycorrhiza potential to grow in
        association with poplars would be of great importance for planning cultivation

        real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) has been frequently used for
        detecting gene expression. To obtain reliable results, selection of suitable
        reference genes is a fundamental and necessary step. Garlic (<jats:italic>Allium
        sativum<\/jats:italic>), a member from Alliaceae family, has been used both
        as a food flavoring and as a traditional medicine. In the present study, garlic
        plants were exposed to salt stress (200 mM NaCl) for 0, 1, 4 and 12 h, and
        garlic roots, bulbs, and leaves were harvested for subsequent analysis. The
        expression stability of eight candidate reference genes, <jats:italic>eukaryotic

        and <jats:italic>protein phosphatase 2A<\/jats:italic> (<jats:italic>PP2A<\/jats:italic>)
        were evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. All genes tested displayed
        variable expression profiles under salt stress. In the leaf and root group,
        <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic> was the best reference gene for normalizing
        gene expression. In garlic clove, <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SAND<\/jats:italic>
        were the least variable, and were suitable for gene expression studies under
        salt stress; these two genes also performed well in all samples tested. Based
        on our results, we recommend that it is essential to use specific reference
        genes in different situations to obtain accurate results. Using a combination
        of multiple stable reference genes, such as <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic>
        and <jats:italic>SAND<\/jats:italic>, to normalize gene expression is encouraged.
        The results from the study will be beneficial for accurate determination of
        gene expression in garlic and other plants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7319","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,16]],"date-time":"2019-07-16T07:30:46Z","timestamp":1563262246000},"page":"e7319","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":19,"title":["Selection

        orb-weaver spider <jats:italic>Meta bourneti<\/jats:italic> Simon 1922 (Araneae:
        Tetragnathidae) is one of the most common cave predators occurring in the
        Mediterranean basin. Although the congeneric <jats:italic>M. menardi<\/jats:italic>
        represented the model species in several studies, our knowledge of <jats:italic>M.
        bourneti<\/jats:italic> is only founded on observations performed on a handful
        of populations. In this study <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic> spiders
        were studied in caves of Monte Albo (Sardinia, Italy) over a year. Generalized
        Linear Mixed Models were used to analyze spider occupancy inside cave environments,
        as well as spider abundance. Analyses on <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic>
        occupancy and abundance were also repeated for adults and juveniles separately.
        Generalized Linear Models, were used to weight species absence based on its
        detection probability. Linear Mixed Models were used to detect possible divergences
        in subterranean spatial use between adult and juvenile spiders. Although widespread
        on the mountain, <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic> generally showed
        low density and low detection probability. Most of the individuals observed
        were juveniles. The spiders generally occupied cave sectors with high ceilings
        that were deep enough to show particular microclimatic features. Adults tended
        to occupy less illuminated areas than juveniles, while the latter were more
        frequently found in sectors showing high humidity. The abundance of <jats:italic>M.\u00a0bourneti<\/jats:italic>
        was strongly related to high humidity and the presence of two troglophile
        species, <jats:italic>Hydromantes flavus<\/jats:italic> Wake, Salvador &amp;
        Alonso-Zarazaga, 2005 (Amphibia: Caudata) and <jats:italic>Oxychilus oppressus<\/jats:italic>
        (Shuttleworth, 1877) (Gastropoda: Panpulmonata). The abundance of juveniles
        was related to sector temperature and humidity, the presence of <jats:italic>H.

        schreberi<\/jats:italic> is a critically endangered aquatic basal angiosperm.
        In this work, we characterized the structure of the glandular trichomes of
        <jats:italic>B. schreberi<\/jats:italic> morphologically and histochemically.
        We used a variety of structural, histochemical and permeability stains for
        the characterization, and we tested the effects of stress in vivo using NaCl
        and ethanol. We observed that the glandular trichome of <jats:italic>B. schreberi<\/jats:italic>
        are composed of two disk-like stalk cells, and a glandular cell which surround
        a cuticular storage space. The cuticle is discontinuous at the surface of
        the shoots. Nearly half of young trichomes senesced in 0.9% NaCl, and mature
        trichomes senesced at 1.8% NaCl. About half of young trichomes senesced under
        3% ethanol and mature trichomes senesced in 2% ethanol after 20 min of treatment.
        The physiology of glandular trichomes affects the way they secrete mucilage
        via storage space at a young stage. The trichomes become permeable and absorb
        ions when mature. This transition depends on the osmiophilic material and
        the dynamic protoplast. It can accelerate senescence and disassembly by ion
        accumulation. Permeability tests and ion treatments of glandular trichomes
        provide new insights for fertilizer research. Our study highlights the structure
        and physiology of <jats:italic>B. schreberi<\/jats:italic> glandular trichomes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7288","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,10]],"date-time":"2019-07-10T07:58:31Z","timestamp":1562745511000},"page":"e7288","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Structure

        null hypothesis testing (NHT) is the primary method for analyzing data in
        many natural sciences, it has been increasingly criticized. Recently, approaches
        based on information theory (IT) have become popular and were held by many
        to be superior because it enables researchers to properly assess the strength
        of the evidence that data provide for competing hypotheses. Many studies have
        compared IT and NHT in the context of model selection and stepwise regression,
        but a systematic comparison of the most basic uses of statistics by ecologists
        is still lacking. We used computer simulations to compare how both approaches
        perform in four basic test designs (t-test, ANOVA, correlation tests, and
        multiple linear regression). Performance was measured by the proportion of
        simulated samples for which each method provided the correct conclusion (power),
        the proportion of detected effects with a wrong sign (S-error), and the mean
        ratio of the estimated effect to the true effect (M-error). We also checked
        if the <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>-value from significance tests correlated
        to a measure of strength of evidence, the Akaike weight. In general both methods
        performed equally well. The concordance is explained by the monotonic relationship
        between <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>-values and evidence weights in simple
        designs, which agree with analytic results. Our results show that researchers
        can agree on the conclusions drawn from a data set even when they are using
        different statistical approaches. By focusing on the practical consequences
        of inferences, such a pragmatic view of statistics can promote insightful
        dialogue among researchers on how to find a common ground from different pieces
        of evidence. A less dogmatic view of statistical inference can also help to
        broaden the debate about the role of statistics in science to the entire path
        that leads from a research hypothesis to a statistical hypothesis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12090","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]],"date-time":"2021-09-01T08:58:20Z","timestamp":1630486700000},"page":"e12090","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Towards

        assemblages are generally characterized by a few dominant species and numerous
        others. Such unequal distributions of dominance also emerge in human society,
        including in scientific communities. Here, based on formal community ecological
        analyses, we show the temporal trends in the number of scientific publication
        in the discipline of \u201cecology.\u201d Based on this, we infer possible
        factors causing the imbalance of reputation and dominance among countries.
        We relied on 454 ecological meta-analysis papers published from 1998 to 2014,
        which sourced over 29,000 original publications. Formal meta-analyses are
        essential for synthesizing findings from individual studies and are critical
        for assessing issues and informing policy. We found that, despite the rapid
        expansion of outlets for ecology papers (analogous to an increase in carrying
        capacity, in ecological systems), country diversity as determined from first
        author affiliations (analogous to species diversity) did not increase. Furthermore,
        a country identity was more powerful than the popularity of the scientific
        topic and affected the chance of publication in high-profile journals, independent
        of the potential novelty of findings and arguments of the papers, suggesting
        possible academic injustice. Consequently, a rank order and hierarchy has
        been gradually formed among countries. Notably, this country-dominance rank
        is not only specific to this scientific domain but also universal across different
        societal situations including sports and economics, further emphasizing that
        inequality and hierarchical structure exist even in modern human society.
        Our study demonstrates a need for having robust frameworks to facilitate equality
        and diversity in the scientific domain in order to better inform society and
        policy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,3]],"date-time":"2015-12-03T04:56:16Z","timestamp":1449118576000},"page":"e1457","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Academic

        recent replication crisis has caused several scientific disciplines to self-reflect
        on the frequency with which they replicate previously published studies and
        to assess their success in such endeavours. The rate of replication, however,
        has yet to be assessed for ecology and evolution. Here, I survey the open-access
        ecology and evolution literature to determine how often ecologists and evolutionary
        biologists replicate, or at least claim to replicate, previously published
        studies. I found that approximately 0.023% of ecology and evolution studies
        are described by their authors as replications. Two of the 11 original-replication
        study pairs provided sufficient statistical detail for three effects so as
        to permit a formal analysis of replication success. Replicating authors correctly
        concluded that they replicated an original effect in two cases; in the third

        in temporally or spatially changing environments is a prerequisite for the
        perpetuation of a given species. In addition to genetic variation, the role
        of epigenetic processes is crucial in the persistence of organisms. For instance,
        mechanisms such as developmental flexibility enable the adjustment of the
        phenotype of a given individual to changing conditions throughout its development.
        However, the extent of factors other than genetic variability, like epigenetic
        processes, in the production of alternative phenotype and the consequences
        in realized ecological niches is still unclear.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In
        this study, we compared the extent of realized niches between asexual and
        sexual individuals from different environments. We used a trait-based ecology
        approach exploiting trophic and locomotive structures to infer the environment
        that each biotype actually used. More specifically, we compared the morphology
        of the all-female clonal and sperm-dependent fish<jats:italic>Chrosomus eos-neogaeus<\/jats:italic>to
        that of their sexual host species<jats:italic>C. eos<\/jats:italic>in common

        from natural to controlled conditions resulted in a similar shift in measured
        morphology for clonal and sexual individuals suggesting comparable level of
        flexibility in both kinds of organisms. However, clonal, but not sexual, individuals
        displayed a consistent phenotype when reared in uniform conditions indicating
        that in absence of genetic variation, one phenotype corresponds to one niche.
        This contrasted with results from natural conditions where clones were morphologically
        as variable as sexual individuals within a sampled site. In addition, similar
        phenotypic changes for both clonal and sexual individuals were observed among
        the majority of sampled sites, indicating that they responded similarly to
        the same environments.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title><jats:p>Our
        results indicated that clones can efficiently use different niches and may
        evolve in a range of environmental conditions comparable to that of a sexual

        were the first vertebrates to develop mineralized dental tools, known as elements.
        Recent research suggests that conodonts were macrophagous predators and\/or
        scavengers but we do not know how this feeding habit emerged in the earliest
        coniform conodonts, since most studies focus on the derived, \u2018complex\u2019
        conodonts. Previous modelling of element position and mechanical properties
        indicate they were capable of food processing. A direct test would be provided
        through evidence of <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic> element crown tissue
        damage or through <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic> incorporated chemical
        proxies for a shift in their trophic position during ontogeny. Here we focus
        on coniform elements from two conodont taxa, the phylogenetically primitive
        <jats:italic>Proconodontus muelleri<\/jats:italic> Miller, 1969 from the late
        Cambrian and the more derived <jats:italic>Panderodus equicostatus<\/jats:italic>
        Rhodes, 1954 from the Silurian. Proposing that this extremely small sample
        is, however, representative for these taxa, we aim to describe in detail the
        growth of an element from each of these taxa in order to the test the following
        hypotheses: (1) <jats:italic>Panderodus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proconodontus<\/jats:italic>
        processed hard food, which led to damage of their elements consistent with
        prey capture function; and (2) both genera shifted towards higher trophic
        levels during ontogeny. We employed backscatter electron (BSE) imaging, energy-dispersive
        X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy
        (SRXTM) to identify growth increments, wear and damage surfaces, and the Sr\/Ca
        ratio in bioapatite as a proxy for the trophic position. Using these data,
        we can identify whether they exhibit determinate or indeterminate growth and
        whether both species followed linear or allometric growth dynamics. Growth
        increments (27 in <jats:italic>Pa. equicostatus<\/jats:italic> and 58 in <jats:italic>Pr.
        muelleri<\/jats:italic>) were formed in bundles of 4\u20137 increments in
        <jats:italic>Pa. equicostatus<\/jats:italic> and 7\u20139 in <jats:italic>Pr.
        muelleri<\/jats:italic>. We interpret the bundles as analogous to Retzius
        periodicity in vertebrate teeth. Based on applied optimal resource allocation
        models, internal periodicity might explain indeterminate growth in both species.
        They also allow us to interpret the almost linear growth of both individuals
        as an indicator that there was no size-dependent increase in mortality in
        the ecosystems where they lived <jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., as would
        be the case in the presence of larger predators. Our findings show that periodic
        growth was present in early conodonts and preceded tissue repair in response
        to wear and damage. We found no microwear and the Sr\/Ca ratio, and therefore
        the trophic position, did not change substantially during the lifetimes of
        either individual. Trophic ecology of coniform conodonts differed from the
        predatory and\/or scavenger lifestyle documented for \u201ccomplex\u201d conodonts.
        We propose that conodonts adapted their life histories to top-down controlled
        ecosystems during the Nekton Revolution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12505","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,14]],"date-time":"2021-12-14T10:02:01Z","timestamp":1639476121000},"page":"e12505","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Growth

        communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation,
        where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making.
        Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media
        and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional
        metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association
        between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score\u2014an indicator
        of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received\u2014along
        with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact
        factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated
        with citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media
        exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling
        a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact
        factors up to \u223c13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing
        citations does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude
        that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research
        through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance
        under traditional measures of scholarly activity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4564","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,12]],"date-time":"2018-04-12T11:00:46Z","timestamp":1523530846000},"page":"e4564","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":46,"title":["Tweet

        complete understanding of the feeding structures is fundamental in order to
        study how animals survive. Some birds use long and protrusible tongues as
        the main tool to collect their central caloric source (e.g., woodpeckers and
        nectarivores). Hummingbirds are the oldest and most diverse clade of nectarivorous
        vertebrates, being a perfect subject to study tongue specializations. Their
        tongue functions to intraorally transport arthropods through their long bills
        and enables them to exploit the nectarivorous niche by collecting small amounts
        of liquid, therefore it is of vital importance to study its anatomy and structure
        at various scales. I focused on the portions of the hummingbird tongue that
        have been shown to be key for understanding their feeding mechanisms. I used
        histology, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, microCT, and<jats:italic>ex-vivo<\/jats:italic>experiments
        in order to advance the comprehension of the morphology and functioning of
        the hummingbird feeding apparatus. I found that hummingbird tongues are composed
        mainly of thin cornified epithelium, lack papillae, and completely fill the
        internal cast of the rostral oropharyngeal cavity. Understanding this puzzle-piece
        match between bill and tongue will be essential for the study of intraoral
        transport of nectar. Likewise, I found that the structural composition and
        tissue architecture of the tongue groove walls provide the rostral portion
        of the tongue with elastic properties that are central to the study of tongue-nectar
        interactions during the feeding process. Detailed studies on hummingbirds
        set the basis for comparisons with other nectar-feeding birds and contribute
        to comprehend the natural solutions to collecting liquids in the most efficient
        way possible.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3449","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,8]],"date-time":"2017-06-08T07:38:38Z","timestamp":1496907518000},"page":"e3449","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Relating

        pollinators provide an essential ecosystem service by transferring pollen
        to crops and native vegetation. The extent to which pollinator communities
        vary both spatially and temporally has important implications for ecology,
        conservation and agricultural production. However, understanding the complex
        interactions that determine pollination service provisioning and production
        measures over space and time has remained a major challenge. Remote sensing
        technologies (RST), including satellite, airborne and ground based sensors,
        are effective tools for measuring the spatial and temporal variability of
        vegetation health, diversity and productivity within natural and modified
        systems. Yet while there are synergies between remote sensing science, pollination
        ecology and agricultural production, research communities have only recently
        begun to actively connect these research areas. Here, we review the utility
        of RST in advancing crop pollination research and highlight knowledge gaps
        and future research priorities. We found that RST are currently used across
        many different research fields to assess changes in plant health and production
        (agricultural production) and to monitor and evaluate changes in biodiversity
        across multiple landscape types (ecology and conservation). In crop pollination
        research, the use of RST are limited and largely restricted to quantifying
        remnant habitat use by pollinators by ascertaining the proportion of, and\/or
        isolation from, a given land use type or local variable. Synchronization between
        research fields is essential to better understand the spatial and temporal
        variability in pollinator dependent crop production. RST enable these applications
        to be scaled across much larger areas than is possible with field-based methods
        and will facilitate large scale ecological changes to be detected and monitored.
        We advocate greater use of RST to better understand interactions between pollination,
        plant health and yield spatial variation in pollinator dependent crops. This
        more holistic approach is necessary for decision-makers to improve strategies
        toward managing multiple land use types and ecosystem services.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5806","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,19]],"date-time":"2018-10-19T09:14:24Z","timestamp":1539940464000},"page":"e5806","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Toward

        properly assess risk, an animal must focus its attention on relevant external
        stimuli; however, attention can be reallocated when distracting stimuli are
        present. This reallocation of attention may interfere with an individual\u2019s
        ability to effectively assess risk and may impede its response. Multiple stimuli
        presented together can have additive effects as distractors, and these include
        stimuli in different modalities. Although changes in noise and water flow
        are detectable by some bivalves, this has not been studied in the context
        of risk assessment or distraction. We experimentally exposed giant clams (<jats:italic>Tridacna
        maxima<\/jats:italic>) to changes in water particle movement through underwater
        sound (motorboat noise) and increased water flow to determine whether these
        stimuli, individually or together, modified risk assessment or caused distraction.
        We found that clams responded to sound, flow, and their combination by increasing
        frequency of mantle retractions (a potential anti-predator response) when
        exposed to a stimulus. Sound alone did not change risk assessment in either
        the latency to close or to reemerge following closure. However, when exposed
        to both stimuli simultaneously, clams increased their latency to close. We
        suggest that clams perceive sound and flow in an additive way, and are thus
        distracted. Interestingly, and uniquely, clams discriminate these multimodal
        stimuli through a single sensory modality. For sessile clams, anthropogenic
        noise is detectable, yet unavoidable, suggesting that they be especially vulnerable
        to marine noise pollution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10050","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]],"date-time":"2020-10-05T09:28:46Z","timestamp":1601890126000},"page":"e10050","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Are

        relationship between feeding ecology and sexual dimorphism is examined in
        a speciose South African monkey beetle clade. We test whether feeding and
        mating at a fixed site (embedding guild) is associated with greater levels
        of sexual dimorphism and possibly sexual selection than species using unpredictable
        feeding resources (non-embedding guild). Sexual dimorphism was measured using
        a point scoring system for hind leg and colour across the two feeding guilds
        for &gt;50% of the regional fauna. Quantification of hind leg dimorphism using
        a scoring system and allometric scaling were used to identify traits subject
        to sexual selection. Feeding guild had a significant effect on hind leg dimorphism,
        with embedders having high and non-embedders low scores. The sessile and defendable
        distribution of females on stable platform flowers may favour contests and
        associated hind leg weaponry. In contrast, degree of colour dimorphism between
        the sexes was not associated with any particular feeding guild, and may serve
        to reduce male conflict and combat. Embedder males had high proportions (\u223c76%)
        of species with positive allometric slopes for almost all hind leg traits.
        For male non-embedders, only \u223c37% of species showed positive scaling
        relationships. Phylogenetic data, in conjunction with behavioural data on
        the function of leg weaponry and visual signalling among males is needed to
        better understand the link between sexual dimorphism and sexual selection
        in the radiation of the monkey beetles.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4632","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,20]],"date-time":"2018-06-20T07:55:02Z","timestamp":1529481302000},"page":"e4632","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Feeding

        fisheries history of the Giant Sea Bass, <jats:italic>Stereolepis gigas<\/jats:italic>
        (Telostei: Polyprionidae), is closely linked to its spatial ecology. Its overharvest
        is directly associated with formation of spatially distinct spawning aggregations
        during summer, while its subsequent recovery is hypothesized to be the result
        of spatially explicit gear restrictions. Understanding the spatial ecology
        of Giant Sea Bass is a key part of efforts to assess contemporary threats
        such as commercial harvest and incidental catch by recreational fisheries.
        In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize Giant Sea Bass space
        use in the La Jolla kelp forest using an acoustic array that encompasses two
        marine protected areas (MPAs) and heavily trafficked recreational fishing
        grounds. Five of the seven fish we tagged remained in the La Jolla array for
        at least 6 months. Two fish were resident across multiple years, with one
        fish consistently detected for 4 years. Only one fish was detected in the
        broader network of regional acoustic receivers, moving north approximately
        8 km to Del Mar. Most tagged fish had home ranges and core use areas indicating
        they spend considerable time outside MPAs, particularly in areas with high
        recreational fishing activity. During spawning season we detected fish less
        frequently in the La Jolla array and recorded higher movement rates. While
        the current MPA network in La Jolla by no means offers complete protection
        to this fish, it does appear to support long-term persistence of some individuals
        in a region of exceptionally high recreational fishing pressure.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.16551","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,19]],"date-time":"2023-12-19T09:17:52Z","timestamp":1702977472000},"page":"e16551","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Spatial

        documenting prey items and diet composition is crucial for understanding a
        predator\u2019s role in the ecosystem. In gape restricted predators, such
        as snakes, documenting and analyzing the type and size of the prey is important
        to interpret their ecological role. We describe the diet patterns of a species
        of venomous snake, the Terciopelo pit viper (<jats:italic>Bothrops asper<\/jats:italic>),
        from its Ecuadorian populations. Examining the gastrointestinal contents of
        museum specimens collected over an extensive area of the Pacific lowlands
        of Ecuador, we encountered 69 identifiable prey items from four major taxonomic
        groups (amphibians, centipedes, mammals, and reptiles). We evaluated the observed
        composition of prey to check for differences between sexes and size-classes.
        To complement our observations of the Terciopelo species complex throughout
        their distribution, we carried out a systematic literature review. Our data
        show an ontogenetic shift in diet, with a transition from more diverse diet
        in juveniles towards a mammal-specialized diet in adults, and distinct proportion
        of prey taxa between the sexes in the juvenile size class.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14817","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,8]],"date-time":"2023-02-08T10:09:03Z","timestamp":1675850943000},"page":"e14817","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Feeding

        systems play an important role in animal survival. Changes to these systems
        may be critical in evolution of species in new environments. Previous studies
        exploring the correlation between feeding ecology and <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
        evolution mainly focused on mammals and birds, and found that the relationship
        was complex. However, in reptiles, the correlation between <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
        evolution and dietary preferences is still unclear. Here, we attempted to
        explore this relationship in representative species of the major groups of
        reptiles (turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodilians), for which the genome information
        is known. We first predicted the functionality (intact, partial, or defective)
        of <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>, and then related it to the feeding preferences.
        As a result, we identified 11 <jats:italic>Tas1r1<\/jats:italic>, 12 <jats:italic>Tas1r2<\/jats:italic>,
        and 12 <jats:italic>Tas1r3<\/jats:italic> genes to be partial or intact and
        another 22 <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> genes to be absent or pseudogenized
        in the 19 reptiles. We found that, as it was revealed in some other vertebrate
        groups, no correlation existed between feeding ecology and <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
        evolution in reptiles: genomic prediction indicated that the <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
        genes possibly have been lost or pseudogenized in snakes, but in crocodylia
        and testudines <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> genes are either intact or
        partial, regardless of their feeding habits. Thus, we suggest that the driving
        force of <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> evolution in reptiles is complex,
        and the feeding habit of swallowing food whole without chewing or the absence
        of taste buds in certain species may account for the possible umami\/sweet
        perception loss. In addition, we propose that caution should be taken when
        predicting gene functionality from the publicly available genome database.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5570","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,24]],"date-time":"2018-08-24T07:53:33Z","timestamp":1535097213000},"page":"e5570","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Molecular

        variations of the ichthyoplankton assemblage and its relationship with the
        environment were analyzed based on four seasonal surveys during 2012. Historical
        data was collected to be compared with results from previous years in order
        to indicate the seasonal and inter-annual variation of the ichthyoplankton
        assemblage in the Yangtze Estuary and the adjacent waters. A total of 3,688
        individuals belonging to 5 orders, 9 families, and 15 species were collected.
        No samples were collected in the winter cruise. In 2012, all samples were
        separated into four ecotypes, which is comparable with the historical data
        from previous years. The <jats:italic>Engraulis japonicus<\/jats:italic> was
        the most abundant species of all teleost fishes. The <jats:italic>E. japonicus<\/jats:italic>
        was captured in every season and contributed the most to the abundance of
        ichthyoplankton, which was greater than that of previous years. This result
        may be due to the periodic fluctuations of <jats:italic>E. japonicus<\/jats:italic>
        or from the displacement of spawning grounds offshore for environmental reasons.
        The diversity indices of the assemblage were significantly different among
        seasons, with the number and abundance of the species peaking in the spring,
        while richness, evenness and diversity indices peaked in the autumn. The species
        richness of the ichthyoplankton varied from 0.74 to 1.62, the Pielou evenness
        index varied from 0.10 to 0.49 and the Shannon\u2013Wiener index varied from
        0.19 to 1.04. The results of CCA analysis showed that the major factors affecting
        the ichthyoplankton assemblage differed throughout the seasons. Chla was the
        key factor affecting the ichthyoplankton in 2012. These seasonal and inter-annual
        variations likely resulted from migrations associated with fish spawning as
        well as the environment. Compared with data from previous studies, the relationship
        between the assemblage structure of ichthyoplankton and corresponding environmental
        variables have undergone a decline.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6482","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,21]],"date-time":"2019-02-21T08:58:14Z","timestamp":1550739494000},"page":"e6482","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["Seasonal
