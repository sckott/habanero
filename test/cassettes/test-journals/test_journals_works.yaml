      biomes in South America are likely to experience a persistent increase in environmental
      temperature, possibly combined with moisture reduction due to climate change.
      In addition, natural fire ignition sources, such as lightning, can become more
      frequent under climate change scenarios since favourable environmental conditions
      are likely to occur more often. In this sense, changes in the frequency and
      magnitude of natural fires can impose novel stressors on different ecosystems
      according to their adaptation to fires. By focusing on Brazilian biomes, we
      use an innovative combination of techniques to quantify fire persistence and
      occurrence patterns over time and evaluate climate risk by considering key fire-related
      climatic characteristics. Then, we tested four major hypotheses considering
      the overall characteristics of fire-dependent, fire-independent, and fire-sensitive
      biomes concerning (1) fire persistence over time; (2) the relationship between
      climate and fire occurrence; (3) future predictions of climate change and its
      potential impacts on fire occurrence; and (4) climate risk faced by biomes.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
      performed a Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to test whether fires in Brazilian
      biomes are persistent over time. We considered four bioclimatic variables whose
      links to fire frequency and intensity are well-established to assess the relationship
      between climate and fire occurrence by confronting these climate predictors
      with a fire occurrence dataset through correlative models. To assess climate
      risk, we calculated the climate hazard, sensitivity, resilience, and vulnerability
      of Brazilian biomes, and then we multiplied the Biomes\u2019 vulnerability index
      by the hazards.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Our
      results indicate a persistent behaviour of fires in all Brazilian biomes at
      almost the same rates, which could represent human-induced patterns of fire
      persistence. We also corroborated our second hypothesis by showing that most
      fire-dependent biomes presented high thermal suitability to fire, while the
      fire-independent biome presented intermediate suitability and fire-sensitive
      biomes are the least suitable for fire occurrence. The third hypothesis was
      partially corroborated since fire-dependent and independent biomes are likely
      to increase their thermal suitability to fire, while fire-sensitive biomes are
      likely to present stable-to-decreasing thermal suitability in the future. Finally,
      our fourth hypothesis was partially corroborated since most fire-dependent biomes
      presented low climate risk, while the fire-independent biome presented a high
      risk and the fire-sensitive biomes presented opposite trends. In summary, while
      the patterns of fire persistence and fire occurrence over time are more likely
      to be related to human-induced fires, key drivers of burned areas are likely
      to be intensified across Brazilian biomes in the future, potentially increasing
      the magnitude of the fires and harming the biomes\u2019 integrity.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14276","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,25]],"date-time":"2022-10-25T07:34:21Z","timestamp":1666683261000},"page":"e14276","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["We\u2019re

      offspring shoots had greater biomass and higher photosynthesis indicators than
      parent shoots. The lowest Pb allocation was found in rhizomes. More of the Pb
      transported to above-ground parts tended to accumulate in parent shoots rather
      than in offspring shoots. Biomass and photosynthesis of offspring shoots, rhizome

      the stability of population propagation and productivity, improving the resistance

      hemipteran insect family Cicadellidae (leafhoppers) includes &gt;2,600 valid
      genera and &gt;22,000 valid species worldwide, including &gt;2,000 species in
      China. Typhlocybinae, second largest subfamilies of Cicadellidae, is widely
      distributed in the six major zoogeographic regions of the world, including &gt;4,000
      species worldwide and &gt;1,000 species in China. Previously, morphological
      analysis are often effective to the way of taxonomy, but it did not combine
      with molecular biology. Therefore, morphology and mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes)
      of two leafhopper species, <jats:italic>Eupteryx<\/jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Eupteryx<\/jats:italic>)
      <jats:italic>minuscula<\/jats:italic> Lindberg, 1929 and <jats:italic>Eupteryx<\/jats:italic>
      (<jats:italic>Stacla<\/jats:italic>) <jats:italic>gracilirama<\/jats:italic>
      Hou, Zhang &amp; Huang, 2016 were studied and analyzed. This study analyzed
      the morphological and molecular characteristics of the two leafhoppers, and
      showed whether the results of the two identifications were consistent.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Based
      on the method of comparison, mitogenomes and morphology were analyzed to prove
      the relationship between the two leafhoppers.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Although
      two focal species are classified in two different subgenera of the same genus,
      they still share many morphological features, such as the moderately produced
      crown fore margin; the milky yellow apical part of scutellum; the pronotum,
      basal triangles of scutellum, and forewing are dark with several colorless patches
      on the surface; the light yellow face, without any spots or stripes, and so
      on. The circular mitogenomes are 16,944 bp long in <jats:italic>E. minuscula<\/jats:italic>
      (GenBank: <jats:uri xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/nuccore\/MN910279\">MN910279<\/jats:uri>)

      All of the protein-coding genes are starting with ATN, except for some in mitogenome,
      which has a single T or TAN as a stop codon. All tRNAs have the typical cloverleaf-shaped
      structure except for <jats:italic>trnS1<\/jats:italic> (AGN) (<jats:italic>E.
      minuscula<\/jats:italic>) which has a reduced DHU arm. Moreover, these two mitogenomes
      have <jats:italic>trnR<\/jats:italic> with an unpaired base in the acceptor
      stem. The phylogenetic relationships between <jats:italic>E. minuscula<\/jats:italic>
      and <jats:italic>E. gracilirama<\/jats:italic> in respect to related lineages
      were reconstructed using Maximum likelihood and Maximum parsimony analyses.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The
      result showed that the tribe Typhlocybini is a sister to the tribes Erythroneurini

      <jats:italic>Eupteryx<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Zyginella<\/jats:italic>

      minuscula<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>E. gracilirama<\/jats:italic> are
      clustered together, supporting the monophyly of the genus <jats:italic>Eupteryx<\/jats:italic>.

      of male-male courtship display is widespread across the animal kingdom. Yet,
      its function and evolutionary origin remain unclear. Here, we hypothesise that
      male-male courtship display evolved in response to selection pressure exerted
      by intrasexual competition during male-female courtship interactions. Intrasexual
      competition can be caused by bystander male pressure through eavesdropping and
      exploiting on displayer male\u2019s courtship interactions with females. This
      bystander pressure can lead to an audience effect by the displayer, who will
      change their courtship behaviour in the presence of bystanders and display directly
      towards them, even in the absence of females, as an intimidation strategy. In
      species where this selection pressure has taken place, we predict that the male
      courtship display will have a dual function: attract females and deter competitors.
      Therefore, we expected to find more evidence of bystander-related behaviours
      in species for which male-male courtship display is linked to intrasexual competition
      compared to species for which other explanatory hypotheses are more plausible
      (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., mistaken identity or courtship practice).<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methodology<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>We
      conducted two systematic reviews to test this hypothesis. First, we conducted
      a search for studies of species with courtship display between males and of
      the hypotheses provided to explain this behaviour. Our goal was to identify
      the species with male-male courtship display and evidence of intrasexual competition.
      Second, among the species with male-male courtship display, we searched for
      evidence of bystander-related behaviours, <jats:italic>i.e<\/jats:italic>.,
      articles referring to eavesdropping, exploitation, and audience effect during
      male-female courtship interactions. Our goal was to test whether species with
      intrasexual competition are also more likely to show bystander-related behaviours.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Although
      most studies reporting male courtship display towards other males do not suggest
      any explanatory hypothesis for this behaviour, the intrasexual competition hypothesis
      was largely mentioned and supported by some studies reviewed. Additionally,
      there is more evidence of eavesdropping and of all three bystander-related behaviours
      combined in species for which the intrasexual competition hypothesis was suggested.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Overall,
      our review supports the hypothesis that intrasexual competition can play a key
      role in male courtship display evolution, namely that male-male courtship display
      may have evolved as a secondary function of male-female courtship interactions
      <jats:italic>via<\/jats:italic> bystander male pressure. However, our review
      also shows that despite the increasing interest in same-sex sexual behaviours,
      and male-male courtship display in particular, most studies were found to be
      merely descriptive, and the hypotheses they suggested to explain courtship display
      between males mostly speculative. This highlights an important gap in the literature.
      To clarify both the evolution and the function of male-male courtship display,
      this behaviour needs to be empirically studied more often. Our review can help
      advancing this research area, as it makes the 20 species with male-male courtship
      display for which the intrasexual competition hypothesis was suggested excellent
      candidates for empirical research.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14638","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,2]],"date-time":"2023-02-02T09:35:54Z","timestamp":1675330554000},"page":"e14638","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["The

      interaction between plants and frugivores is crucial to ecosystem function and
      community diversity. However, little is known about the interaction between
      plants and frugivorous bird species in urban green spaces. We observed interactions
      between plants and frugivorous birds in the Guilin Botanical Garden for one
      year and determined the structure and characteristics of the interaction network.
      We also analyzed the impact of species traits on their network roles. Interactions
      between 14 frugivorous birds and 13 fruit plant species were recorded in the
      study area. Autumn interactions comprised 38.79% of the overall network, and
      winter interactions comprised 33.15%. The modularity (<jats:italic>Q<\/jats:italic>,
      <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network was higher in autumn; the
      weighted nestedness (<jats:italic>wNODF<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score)
      and interaction evenness (<jats:italic>E<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>,
      <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network were higher in winter; the
      connectance (<jats:italic>C<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score)
      and interaction diversity (<jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network
      were higher in spring; and the specialization (<jats:italic>H<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\u2032<\/jats:italic>,
      <jats:italic>z<\/jats:italic>-score) of the network was higher in summer. The
      observed network showed lower <jats:italic>C<\/jats:italic>, lower interaction
      <jats:italic>H<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>, lower <jats:italic>E<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub><\/jats:italic>
      , lower <jats:italic>wNODF<\/jats:italic>, higher <jats:italic>H<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\u2032<\/jats:italic>
      and higher <jats:italic>Q<\/jats:italic> when compared to the random networks.
      The bird species most important to network stability were <jats:italic>Hemixos
      castanonotus<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Parus venustulus<\/jats:italic>, and
      <jats:italic>Pycnonotus sinensis<\/jats:italic>. The most important plant species
      were <jats:italic>Alocasia macrorrhiza<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Cinnamomum
      camphora<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Machilus nanmu<\/jats:italic>. Of
      all the bird and plant traits included in this study, only plant color had a
      significant impact on species strength, with black fruit having a higher species
      strength. Our results suggest that interaction networks in urban green spaces
      can be temporally complex and variable and that a network approach can be an
      important monitoring tool for detecting the status of crucial ecosystem functions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15028","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,16]],"date-time":"2023-03-16T09:41:28Z","timestamp":1678959688000},"page":"e15028","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Structure

      the expansion of the mining industry, environmental pollution from microelements
      (MP) and red mud (RM) has become a pressing issue. While bioremediation offers
      a cost-effective and sustainable solution, plant growth in these polluted environments
      remains difficult. <jats:italic>Arundo donax<\/jats:italic> is one of the few
      plants capable of surviving in RM-affected soils. To identify endophytic fungi
      that support <jats:italic>A. donax<\/jats:italic> in different contaminated
      environments and to inform future research combining mycorrhizal techniques
      with hyperaccumulator plants, we conducted a field experiment. The study compared
      endophytic fungal communities in <jats:italic>A. donax<\/jats:italic> grown
      in uncontaminated, MP soils contaminated with cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and
      lead (Pb), and RM-contaminated soils. Our findings showed that soil nutrient
      profiles differed by contamination type, with Cd concentrations in MP soils
      exceeding national pollution standards (GB 15168-2018) and RM soils characterized
      by high aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and alkalinity. There were significant differences
      in the endophytic fungal community structures across the three soil types (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>
      &lt; 0.001). Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that endophytic fungi in
      MP soils exhibited competitive niche dynamics, whereas fungi in RM soils tended
      to share niches. Notably, <jats:italic>Pleosporales<\/jats:italic> sp., which
      accounted for 18% of the relative abundance in RM soils, was identified as a
      dominant and beneficial endophyte, making it a promising candidate for future
      bioremediation efforts. This study provides valuable insights into the role
      of endophytic fungi in phytoremediation and highlights their potential as resources
      for improving plant-microbe interactions in contaminated environments.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.18789","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,10]],"date-time":"2025-01-10T09:06:26Z","timestamp":1736499986000},"page":"e18789","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Soil

      is one of the most frequently occurring stressors confronted by industrial cultures
      of sea cucumber and can cause large economic losses and resource degradation.
      However, its responsive mechanisms are still lacking. In this paper, the physiological
      responses of <jats:italic>Apostichopus japonicus<\/jats:italic> to oxygen deficiency
      was illustrated, including induced oxidative response and immune defense and
      changed digestive enzymes activities. Significantly increased activities of
      alpha-amylase (AMS), acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate dehydrogenase, catalase,
      peroxidase, succinate dehydrogenase and higher content of malondialdehyde, and
      decreased activities of lipase and trypsin (TRY) were observed after hypoxia
      exposure (dissolved oxygen [DO] 2 mg\/L). Expressions of key genes showed that
      <jats:italic>AMS, peptidase, ACP, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, heat shock
      protein 70<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>glutathione peroxidase<\/jats:italic>
      were increased and <jats:italic>TRY<\/jats:italic> was decreased under hypoxia.
      With the decline of the DO level, the decreased tendency of oxygen consumption
      rates was different in varied weight groups. Moreover, respiratory trees were
      observed degraded under long-term hypoxia stress, thus leading a negative effect
      of respiration. These results could help to develop a better understanding of
      the responsive mechanism of sea cucumber under hypoxia stress and provide a
      theoretical basis for the prevention of hypoxia risk.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4651","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,27]],"date-time":"2018-04-27T08:43:11Z","timestamp":1524818591000},"page":"e4651","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":76,"title":["Impact

      of winter wheat yield under dryland conditions depends on improving soil water
      stored during fallow and its efficient use. A 3-year field experiment was conducted
      in Loess Plateau to access the effect of tillage and N (nitrogen) rates on soil
      water, N distribution and water- and nitrogen-use efficiency of winter wheat.
      Deep tillage (DT, 25\u201330 cm depth) and no-tillage (NT) were operated during
      fallow season, whereas four N rates (0, 90, 150 and 210 kg ha<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>)
      were applied before sowing. Rates of N and variable rainfall during summer fallow
      period led to the difference of soil water storage. Soil water storage at anthesis
      and maturity was decreased with increasing N rate especially in the year with
      high precipitation (2014\u20132015). DT has increased the soil water storage
      at sowing, N content, numbers of spike, grain number, 1,000 grain weight, grain
      yield, and water and N use efficiency as compared to NT. Grain yield was significantly
      and positively related to soil water consumption at sowing to anthesis and anthesis
      to maturity, total plant N, and water-use efficiency. Our study implies that
      optimum N rate and deep tillage during the fallow season could improve dryland
      wheat production by balancing the water consumption and biomass production.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8892","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]],"date-time":"2020-04-30T08:37:42Z","timestamp":1588235862000},"page":"e8892","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Soil

      warming can cause variation in plant functional traits due to phenotypic plasticity
      or rapid microevolutionary change. Seed mass represents a fundamental axis of
      trait variation in plants, from an individual to a community scale. Here, we
      hypothesize that long-term warming can shift the mean seed mass of species.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>We
      tested our hypothesis in plots that had been warmed over 18 years in alpine
      meadow communities with a history of light grazing (LG) and heavy grazing (HG)
      on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. In this study, seeds were collected during the
      growing season of 2015.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>We
      found that warming increased the mean seed mass of 4 (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a019)
      species in the LG meadow and 6 (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a020)
      species in the HG meadow, while decreasing the mean seed mass of 6 species in
      the LG and HG meadows, respectively. For 7 species, grazing history modified
      the effect of warming on seed mass. Therefore, we concluded that long-term warming
      can shift the mean seed mass at the species level. However, the direction of
      this variation is species-specific. Our study suggests that mean seed mass of
      alpine plant species appears to decrease in warmer (less stressful) habitats
      based on life-history theory, but it also suggests there may be an underlying
      trade-off in which mean seed mass may increase due to greater thermal energy
      inputs into seed development. Furthermore, the physical and biotic environment
      modulating this trade-off result in complex patterns of variation in mean seed
      mass of alpine plant species facing global warming.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7416","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]],"date-time":"2019-07-31T07:18:12Z","timestamp":1564557492000},"page":"e7416","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Long-term

      surveys conducted on Reunion Island coral reefs revealed an atypical manifestation
      of black band disease on the main framework building coral, Porites lutea. This
      BBD manifestation (PorBBD) presented a thick lighter-colored band, which preceded
      the typical BBD lesion. Whilst BBD aetiology has been intensively described
      worldwide, it remains unclear if corals with apparently similar lesions across
      coral reefs are affected by the same pathogens. Therefore, a multidisciplinary
      approach involving field surveys, gross lesion monitoring, histopathology and
      454-pyrosequencing was employed to provide the first comprehensive characterization
      of this particular manifestation. Surveys conducted within two geomorphological
      zones over two consecutive summers and winters showed spatial and seasonal patterns
      consistent with those found for typical BBD. Genetic analyses suggested an uncharacteristically
      high level of Vibrio spp. bacterial infection within PorBBD. However, microscopic
      analysis revealed high densities of cyanobacteria, penetrating the compromised
      tissue as well as the presence of basophilic bodies resembling bacterial aggregates
      in the living tissue, adjacent to the bacterial mat. Additionally, classical
      BBD-associated cyanobacterial strains, genetically related to Pseudoscillatoria
      coralii and Roseofilum reptotaenium were identified and isolated and the presence
      of sulfate-reducers or sulfide-oxidizers such as Desulfovibrio and Arcobacter,
      previously shown to be associated with anoxic microenvironment within typical
      BBD was also observed, confirming that PorBBD is a manifestation of classical
      BBD.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2073","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,6]],"date-time":"2016-07-06T07:53:42Z","timestamp":1467791622000},"page":"e2073","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Characterisation

      sequences of marine streptomycetes are valuable for the discovery of useful
      enzymes and bioactive compounds by genome mining. However, publicly available
      complete genome sequences of marine streptomycetes are still limited. Here,
      we present the complete genome sequence of a marine streptomycete<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
      S063 CGMCC 14582. Species delineation based on the pairwise digital DNA-DNA
      hybridization and genome comparison ANI (average nucleotide identity) value
      showed that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063 CGMCC 14582 possesses
      a unique genome that is clearly different from all of the other available genomes.
      Bioactivity tests showed that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063
      CGMCC 14582 produces metabolites with anti-complement activities, which are
      useful for treatment of numerous diseases that arise from inappropriate activation
      of the human complement system. Analysis of the genome reveals no biosynthetic
      gene cluster (BGC) which shows even low similarity to that of the known anti-complement
      agents was detected in the genome, indicating that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
      S063 CGMCC 14582 may produce novel anti-complement agents of microbial origin.
      Four BGCs which are potentially involved in biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides
      were disrupted, but no decrease of anti-complement activities was observed,
      suggesting that these four BGCs are not involved in biosynthesis of the anti-complement
      agents. In addition, LC-MS\/MS analysis and subsequent alignment through the
      Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform led to the
      detection of novel peptides produced by the strain.<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp.
      S063 CGMCC 14582 grows rapidly and is salt tolerant, which benefits efficient
      secondary metabolite production via seawater-based fermentation. Our results
      indicate that<jats:italic>Streptomyces<\/jats:italic>sp. S063 has great potential
      to produce novel bioactive compounds, and also is a good host for heterologous

      bar-headed goose (<jats:italic>Anser indicus<\/jats:italic>) mainly inhabits
      the plateau wetlands of Asia. As a specialized high-altitude species, bar-headed
      geese can migrate between South and Central Asia and annually fly twice over
      the Himalayan mountains along the central Asian flyway. The physiological, biochemical
      and behavioral adaptations of bar-headed geese to high-altitude living and flying
      have raised much interest. However, to date, there is still no genome assembly
      information publicly available for bar-headed geese.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In
      this study, we present the first de novo whole genome sequencing and assembly

      Genomics sequencing produced a total of 124 Gb sequencing data, which can cover
      the estimated genome size of bar-headed goose for 103 times (average coverage).
      The genome assembly comprised 10,528 scaffolds, with a total length of 1.143
      Gb and a scaffold N50 of 10.09 Mb. Annotation of the bar-headed goose genome
      assembly identified a total of 102 Mb (8.9%) of repetitive sequences, 16,428
      protein-coding genes, and 282 tRNAs. In total, we determined that there were
      63 expanded and 20 contracted gene families in the bar-headed goose compared
      with the other 15 vertebrates. We also performed a positive selection analysis
      between the bar-headed goose and the closely related low-altitude goose, swan
      goose (<jats:italic>Anser cygnoides<\/jats:italic>), to uncover its genetic
      adaptations to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title><jats:p>We
      reported the currently most complete genome sequence of the bar-headed goose.
      Our assembly will provide a valuable resource to enhance further studies of
      the gene functions of bar-headed goose. The data will also be valuable for facilitating
      studies of the evolution, population genetics and high-altitude adaptations
      of the bar-headed geese at the genomic level.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8914","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,6]],"date-time":"2020-04-06T07:18:58Z","timestamp":1586157538000},"page":"e8914","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["First

      use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis
      of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad
      range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model
      structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always
      straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires
      that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide
      a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological
      data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical
      modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection,
      with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference
      in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references
      that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding.
      This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for
      applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing
      so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological
      and evolutionary questions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4794","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,23]],"date-time":"2018-05-23T08:55:29Z","timestamp":1527065729000},"page":"e4794","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1514,"title":["A

      real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) has been frequently used for detecting
      gene expression. To obtain reliable results, selection of suitable reference
      genes is a fundamental and necessary step. Garlic (<jats:italic>Allium sativum<\/jats:italic>),
      a member from Alliaceae family, has been used both as a food flavoring and as
      a traditional medicine. In the present study, garlic plants were exposed to
      salt stress (200 mM NaCl) for 0, 1, 4 and 12 h, and garlic roots, bulbs, and
      leaves were harvested for subsequent analysis. The expression stability of eight

      were evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. All genes tested displayed
      variable expression profiles under salt stress. In the leaf and root group,
      <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic> was the best reference gene for normalizing
      gene expression. In garlic clove, <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>SAND<\/jats:italic>
      were the least variable, and were suitable for gene expression studies under
      salt stress; these two genes also performed well in all samples tested. Based
      on our results, we recommend that it is essential to use specific reference
      genes in different situations to obtain accurate results. Using a combination
      of multiple stable reference genes, such as <jats:italic>ACTIN<\/jats:italic>
      and <jats:italic>SAND<\/jats:italic>, to normalize gene expression is encouraged.
      The results from the study will be beneficial for accurate determination of
      gene expression in garlic and other plants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7319","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,16]],"date-time":"2019-07-16T07:30:46Z","timestamp":1563262246000},"page":"e7319","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":25,"title":["Selection

      northern China, precipitation that is primarily concentrated during the fallow
      period is insufficient for the growth stage, creates a moisture shortage, and
      leads to low, unstable yields. Yield prediction in the early growth stages significantly
      informs field management decisions for winter wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum<\/jats:italic>
      L.). A 10-year field experiment carried out in the Loess Plateau area tested
      how three tillage practices (deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no tillage
      (NT)) influenced cultivation and yield across different fallow periods. The
      experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model
      of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the
      fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat.
      Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield
      than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed
      fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was
      developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage
      after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values
      existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike.
      Additionally, the relative error of crop yield under fallow tillage (5.24%)
      was smaller than that of NT (6.49%). The prediction error of relative meteorological
      yield was minimum and optimal, indicating that the model is suitable to explain
      the influence of meteorological factors on yield.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12602","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]],"date-time":"2021-12-08T10:11:55Z","timestamp":1638958315000},"page":"e12602","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Effects

      is an edible commercial sequestrate genus that is globally distributed. From
      the five described taxa of this genus, <jats:italic>Mattirolomyces terfezioides<\/jats:italic>
      is the most common species in Asia. Our recent attempts to locate <jats:italic>M.
      terfezioides<\/jats:italic> outside its current distribution area in China documented
      its first records in areas of poplar trees with the lowest known temperature
      and precipitation averages ever recorded for this species. This peculiar ecology
      was not reflected on the species-morphological features nor on its phylogenetic
      position in the genus. The first attempt to apply the phylogenetic network approach
      to <jats:italic>Mattirolomyces<\/jats:italic> revealed its geographic origin
      in the Asian-Pacific areas prior to frequent long-distance migration events.
      Based on data from recent study areas, we found that the collections from Inner
      Mongolia and the Shanxi province were similar to European collections. Asian
      haplotypes were less distant from the outgroup comparing to collections from
      Europe, supporting the hypothesis that <jats:italic>M. terfezioides<\/jats:italic>
      was originated from this Chinese area and was subsequently transported to Europe.
      Exploring <jats:italic>M. terfezioides<\/jats:italic> ecology and its mycorrhiza
      potential to grow in association with poplars would be of great importance for
      planning cultivation projects of this valuable desert truffle species in Central

      orb-weaver spider <jats:italic>Meta bourneti<\/jats:italic> Simon 1922 (Araneae:
      Tetragnathidae) is one of the most common cave predators occurring in the Mediterranean
      basin. Although the congeneric <jats:italic>M. menardi<\/jats:italic> represented
      the model species in several studies, our knowledge of <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic>
      is only founded on observations performed on a handful of populations. In this
      study <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic> spiders were studied in caves
      of Monte Albo (Sardinia, Italy) over a year. Generalized Linear Mixed Models
      were used to analyze spider occupancy inside cave environments, as well as spider
      abundance. Analyses on <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic> occupancy and
      abundance were also repeated for adults and juveniles separately. Generalized
      Linear Models, were used to weight species absence based on its detection probability.
      Linear Mixed Models were used to detect possible divergences in subterranean
      spatial use between adult and juvenile spiders. Although widespread on the mountain,
      <jats:italic>M. bourneti<\/jats:italic> generally showed low density and low
      detection probability. Most of the individuals observed were juveniles. The
      spiders generally occupied cave sectors with high ceilings that were deep enough
      to show particular microclimatic features. Adults tended to occupy less illuminated
      areas than juveniles, while the latter were more frequently found in sectors
      showing high humidity. The abundance of <jats:italic>M.\u00a0bourneti<\/jats:italic>
      was strongly related to high humidity and the presence of two troglophile species,
      <jats:italic>Hydromantes flavus<\/jats:italic> Wake, Salvador &amp; Alonso-Zarazaga,
      2005 (Amphibia: Caudata) and <jats:italic>Oxychilus oppressus<\/jats:italic>
      (Shuttleworth, 1877) (Gastropoda: Panpulmonata). The abundance of juveniles
      was related to sector temperature and humidity, the presence of <jats:italic>H.
      flavus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>O. oppressus<\/jats:italic> and to morphological
      sector features. However, when only adults were considered, no significant relationships
      were found. Adult and juvenile spiders did not differ in their spatial distribution
      inside the caves studied, but a seasonal distribution of the species along cave
      walls was observed. Microclimate was one of the most important features affecting
      both the presence and abundance of <jats:italic>M.\u00a0bourneti<\/jats:italic>
      in subterranean environments. Individuals tended to occupy lower heights during
      hot seasons.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6049","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,29]],"date-time":"2018-11-29T09:04:32Z","timestamp":1543482272000},"page":"e6049","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":17,"title":["Ecology

      schreberi<\/jats:italic> is a critically endangered aquatic basal angiosperm.
      In this work, we characterized the structure of the glandular trichomes of <jats:italic>B.
      schreberi<\/jats:italic> morphologically and histochemically. We used a variety
      of structural, histochemical and permeability stains for the characterization,
      and we tested the effects of stress in vivo using NaCl and ethanol. We observed
      that the glandular trichome of <jats:italic>B. schreberi<\/jats:italic> are
      composed of two disk-like stalk cells, and a glandular cell which surround a
      cuticular storage space. The cuticle is discontinuous at the surface of the
      shoots. Nearly half of young trichomes senesced in 0.9% NaCl, and mature trichomes
      senesced at 1.8% NaCl. About half of young trichomes senesced under 3% ethanol
      and mature trichomes senesced in 2% ethanol after 20 min of treatment. The physiology
      of glandular trichomes affects the way they secrete mucilage via storage space
      at a young stage. The trichomes become permeable and absorb ions when mature.
      This transition depends on the osmiophilic material and the dynamic protoplast.
      It can accelerate senescence and disassembly by ion accumulation. Permeability
      tests and ion treatments of glandular trichomes provide new insights for fertilizer
      research. Our study highlights the structure and physiology of <jats:italic>B.

      assemblages are generally characterized by a few dominant species and numerous
      others. Such unequal distributions of dominance also emerge in human society,
      including in scientific communities. Here, based on formal community ecological
      analyses, we show the temporal trends in the number of scientific publication
      in the discipline of \u201cecology.\u201d Based on this, we infer possible factors
      causing the imbalance of reputation and dominance among countries. We relied
      on 454 ecological meta-analysis papers published from 1998 to 2014, which sourced
      over 29,000 original publications. Formal meta-analyses are essential for synthesizing
      findings from individual studies and are critical for assessing issues and informing
      policy. We found that, despite the rapid expansion of outlets for ecology papers
      (analogous to an increase in carrying capacity, in ecological systems), country
      diversity as determined from first author affiliations (analogous to species
      diversity) did not increase. Furthermore, a country identity was more powerful
      than the popularity of the scientific topic and affected the chance of publication
      in high-profile journals, independent of the potential novelty of findings and
      arguments of the papers, suggesting possible academic injustice. Consequently,
      a rank order and hierarchy has been gradually formed among countries. Notably,
      this country-dominance rank is not only specific to this scientific domain but
      also universal across different societal situations including sports and economics,
      further emphasizing that inequality and hierarchical structure exist even in
      modern human society. Our study demonstrates a need for having robust frameworks
      to facilitate equality and diversity in the scientific domain in order to better
      inform society and policy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,3]],"date-time":"2015-12-03T04:56:16Z","timestamp":1449118576000},"page":"e1457","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Academic

      null hypothesis testing (NHT) is the primary method for analyzing data in many
      natural sciences, it has been increasingly criticized. Recently, approaches
      based on information theory (IT) have become popular and were held by many to
      be superior because it enables researchers to properly assess the strength of
      the evidence that data provide for competing hypotheses. Many studies have compared
      IT and NHT in the context of model selection and stepwise regression, but a
      systematic comparison of the most basic uses of statistics by ecologists is
      still lacking. We used computer simulations to compare how both approaches perform
      in four basic test designs (t-test, ANOVA, correlation tests, and multiple linear
      regression). Performance was measured by the proportion of simulated samples
      for which each method provided the correct conclusion (power), the proportion
      of detected effects with a wrong sign (S-error), and the mean ratio of the estimated
      effect to the true effect (M-error). We also checked if the <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>-value
      from significance tests correlated to a measure of strength of evidence, the
      Akaike weight. In general both methods performed equally well. The concordance
      is explained by the monotonic relationship between <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>-values
      and evidence weights in simple designs, which agree with analytic results. Our
      results show that researchers can agree on the conclusions drawn from a data
      set even when they are using different statistical approaches. By focusing on
      the practical consequences of inferences, such a pragmatic view of statistics
      can promote insightful dialogue among researchers on how to find a common ground
      from different pieces of evidence. A less dogmatic view of statistical inference
      can also help to broaden the debate about the role of statistics in science
      to the entire path that leads from a research hypothesis to a statistical hypothesis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12090","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]],"date-time":"2021-09-01T08:58:20Z","timestamp":1630486700000},"page":"e12090","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Towards

      recent replication crisis has caused several scientific disciplines to self-reflect
      on the frequency with which they replicate previously published studies and
      to assess their success in such endeavours. The rate of replication, however,
      has yet to be assessed for ecology and evolution. Here, I survey the open-access
      ecology and evolution literature to determine how often ecologists and evolutionary
      biologists replicate, or at least claim to replicate, previously published studies.
      I found that approximately 0.023% of ecology and evolution studies are described
      by their authors as replications. Two of the 11 original-replication study pairs
      provided sufficient statistical detail for three effects so as to permit a formal
      analysis of replication success. Replicating authors correctly concluded that
      they replicated an original effect in two cases; in the third case, my analysis
      suggests that the finding by the replicating authors was consistent with the
      original finding, contrary the conclusion of \u201creplication failure\u201d

      were the first vertebrates to develop mineralized dental tools, known as elements.
      Recent research suggests that conodonts were macrophagous predators and\/or
      scavengers but we do not know how this feeding habit emerged in the earliest
      coniform conodonts, since most studies focus on the derived, \u2018complex\u2019
      conodonts. Previous modelling of element position and mechanical properties
      indicate they were capable of food processing. A direct test would be provided
      through evidence of <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic> element crown tissue
      damage or through <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic> incorporated chemical
      proxies for a shift in their trophic position during ontogeny. Here we focus
      on coniform elements from two conodont taxa, the phylogenetically primitive
      <jats:italic>Proconodontus muelleri<\/jats:italic> Miller, 1969 from the late
      Cambrian and the more derived <jats:italic>Panderodus equicostatus<\/jats:italic>
      Rhodes, 1954 from the Silurian. Proposing that this extremely small sample is,
      however, representative for these taxa, we aim to describe in detail the growth
      of an element from each of these taxa in order to the test the following hypotheses:
      (1) <jats:italic>Panderodus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Proconodontus<\/jats:italic>
      processed hard food, which led to damage of their elements consistent with prey
      capture function; and (2) both genera shifted towards higher trophic levels
      during ontogeny. We employed backscatter electron (BSE) imaging, energy-dispersive
      X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy
      (SRXTM) to identify growth increments, wear and damage surfaces, and the Sr\/Ca
      ratio in bioapatite as a proxy for the trophic position. Using these data, we
      can identify whether they exhibit determinate or indeterminate growth and whether
      both species followed linear or allometric growth dynamics. Growth increments
      (27 in <jats:italic>Pa. equicostatus<\/jats:italic> and 58 in <jats:italic>Pr.
      muelleri<\/jats:italic>) were formed in bundles of 4\u20137 increments in <jats:italic>Pa.
      equicostatus<\/jats:italic> and 7\u20139 in <jats:italic>Pr. muelleri<\/jats:italic>.
      We interpret the bundles as analogous to Retzius periodicity in vertebrate teeth.
      Based on applied optimal resource allocation models, internal periodicity might
      explain indeterminate growth in both species. They also allow us to interpret
      the almost linear growth of both individuals as an indicator that there was
      no size-dependent increase in mortality in the ecosystems where they lived <jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>.,
      as would be the case in the presence of larger predators. Our findings show
      that periodic growth was present in early conodonts and preceded tissue repair
      in response to wear and damage. We found no microwear and the Sr\/Ca ratio,
      and therefore the trophic position, did not change substantially during the
      lifetimes of either individual. Trophic ecology of coniform conodonts differed
      from the predatory and\/or scavenger lifestyle documented for \u201ccomplex\u201d
      conodonts. We propose that conodonts adapted their life histories to top-down
      controlled ecosystems during the Nekton Revolution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12505","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,14]],"date-time":"2021-12-14T10:02:01Z","timestamp":1639476121000},"page":"e12505","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Growth

      ecological niches is still unclear.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In
      this study, we compared the extent of realized niches between asexual and sexual
      individuals from different environments. We used a trait-based ecology approach
      exploiting trophic and locomotive structures to infer the environment that each
      biotype actually used. More specifically, we compared the morphology of the
      all-female clonal and sperm-dependent fish<jats:italic>Chrosomus eos-neogaeus<\/jats:italic>to
      that of their sexual host species<jats:italic>C. eos<\/jats:italic>in common
      garden and natural conditions.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>Transfer
      from natural to controlled conditions resulted in a similar shift in measured
      morphology for clonal and sexual individuals suggesting comparable level of
      flexibility in both kinds of organisms. However, clonal, but not sexual, individuals
      displayed a consistent phenotype when reared in uniform conditions indicating
      that in absence of genetic variation, one phenotype corresponds to one niche.
      This contrasted with results from natural conditions where clones were morphologically
      as variable as sexual individuals within a sampled site. In addition, similar
      phenotypic changes for both clonal and sexual individuals were observed among
      the majority of sampled sites, indicating that they responded similarly to the
      same environments.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title><jats:p>Our
      results indicated that clones can efficiently use different niches and may evolve
      in a range of environmental conditions comparable to that of a sexual species,
      thus underlying the importance of factors other than genetic variability, like
      epigenetic processes, for coping with environmental heterogeneity.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5896","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,2]],"date-time":"2018-11-02T09:08:56Z","timestamp":1541149736000},"page":"e5896","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["A

      communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation,
      where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making.
      Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media
      and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional
      metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association
      between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score\u2014an indicator of
      the amount and reach of the attention an article has received\u2014along with
      other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor,
      and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated with
      citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media exposure
      did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling a
      diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact factors
      up to \u223c13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations
      does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude that
      ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research
      through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance
      under traditional measures of scholarly activity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4564","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,12]],"date-time":"2018-04-12T11:00:46Z","timestamp":1523530846000},"page":"e4564","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":56,"title":["Tweet

      mendica<\/jats:italic> (Fabricius, 1775) is a large mantid species found from
      the Canary Islands across North Africa, the Middle East, and Pakistan. Research
      on this species has been limited, especially in Iran, despite the country\u2019s
      potential significance for studying its biology and distribution. Adults of
      this species are easily recognizable by their marble-white pattern and rhomboidal
      leaf-like pronotum. They are sit-and-wait predators that inhabit various open
      environments.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Field

      a focus on Morocco, Tunisia, and Iran. Distribution data for <jats:italic>B.
      mendica<\/jats:italic>were gathered from fieldwork, museum collections, online
      biodiversity databases, and publications, totaling 593 occurrence points. Ecological
      niche modeling was performed using environmental data, and various models were
      evaluated for suitability. Phylogeographic analyses involved DNA sequencing
      and construction of a haplotype network to examine genetic relationships between
      populations. Divergence time estimation and biogeographical range expansion
      models were applied to explore historical distribution shifts of the species
      across different regions. The study provided comprehensive insights into the
      biology, distribution, and genetic history of <jats:italic>B. mendica<\/jats:italic>.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
      provide information on the life cycle, ootheca, defense behavior, habitat, and
      biogeography of the Egyptian Flower mantis <jats:italic>Blepharopsis mendica<\/jats:italic>.
      This mantid is an overwintering univoltine species with nymphs emerging in summer
      and becoming adults in spring. In the wild, females start oviposition in April
      and can lay their first ootheca within a week after mating. The species is distributed
      from the Canary Islands to Pakistan in the dry belt. Thus, its distribution
      is associated with xeric areas or desert and semi-desert habitats. Phylogeographic
      analyses revealed three major genetic lineages, (i) in the Maghreb, (ii) from
      Egypt via Arabia to Iran (with internal substructures), and (iii) likely in
      Pakistan; the estimated onset of differentiation into these lineages is of Pleistocene
      age. Defense behavior involves flying away or extending wings broadly and lifting
      forelegs. Performing laboratory breeding, we documented life cycle and color
      changes from first instar to adulthood. Due to overwintering, the last larval
      instar needs considerably longer than the others. At 25\u00a0\u00b0C (\u00b12),
      average adult life span was 118 days (\u00b16 SD) for females (range: 100\u2013124)
      and 46 days (\u00b15 SD) for males (range: 39\u201355), with a significant difference
      among sexes. On average, oothecae contained 32.3 eggs (\u00b110.1 SD) and the
      mean incubation period was 36.8 days (\u00b12.9 SD). We did not find evidence
      of parthenogenesis. In general, the biology of <jats:italic>B. mendica<\/jats:italic>
      shows a variety of adaptations to its often extreme and little predictable type
      of habitat.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.16814","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,29]],"date-time":"2024-01-29T08:12:56Z","timestamp":1706515976000},"page":"e16814","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Biology,

      complete understanding of the feeding structures is fundamental in order to
      study how animals survive. Some birds use long and protrusible tongues as the
      main tool to collect their central caloric source (e.g., woodpeckers and nectarivores).
      Hummingbirds are the oldest and most diverse clade of nectarivorous vertebrates,
      being a perfect subject to study tongue specializations. Their tongue functions
      to intraorally transport arthropods through their long bills and enables them
      to exploit the nectarivorous niche by collecting small amounts of liquid, therefore
      it is of vital importance to study its anatomy and structure at various scales.
      I focused on the portions of the hummingbird tongue that have been shown to
      be key for understanding their feeding mechanisms. I used histology, transmission
      and scanning electron microscopy, microCT, and<jats:italic>ex-vivo<\/jats:italic>experiments
      in order to advance the comprehension of the morphology and functioning of the
      hummingbird feeding apparatus. I found that hummingbird tongues are composed
      mainly of thin cornified epithelium, lack papillae, and completely fill the
      internal cast of the rostral oropharyngeal cavity. Understanding this puzzle-piece
      match between bill and tongue will be essential for the study of intraoral transport
      of nectar. Likewise, I found that the structural composition and tissue architecture
      of the tongue groove walls provide the rostral portion of the tongue with elastic
      properties that are central to the study of tongue-nectar interactions during
      the feeding process. Detailed studies on hummingbirds set the basis for comparisons
      with other nectar-feeding birds and contribute to comprehend the natural solutions
      to collecting liquids in the most efficient way possible.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3449","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,8]],"date-time":"2017-06-08T07:38:38Z","timestamp":1496907518000},"page":"e3449","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":["Relating

      pollinators provide an essential ecosystem service by transferring pollen to
      crops and native vegetation. The extent to which pollinator communities vary
      both spatially and temporally has important implications for ecology, conservation
      and agricultural production. However, understanding the complex interactions
      that determine pollination service provisioning and production measures over
      space and time has remained a major challenge. Remote sensing technologies (RST),
      including satellite, airborne and ground based sensors, are effective tools
      for measuring the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation health, diversity
      and productivity within natural and modified systems. Yet while there are synergies
      between remote sensing science, pollination ecology and agricultural production,
      research communities have only recently begun to actively connect these research
      areas. Here, we review the utility of RST in advancing crop pollination research
      and highlight knowledge gaps and future research priorities. We found that RST
      are currently used across many different research fields to assess changes in
      plant health and production (agricultural production) and to monitor and evaluate
      changes in biodiversity across multiple landscape types (ecology and conservation).
      In crop pollination research, the use of RST are limited and largely restricted
      to quantifying remnant habitat use by pollinators by ascertaining the proportion
      of, and\/or isolation from, a given land use type or local variable. Synchronization
      between research fields is essential to better understand the spatial and temporal
      variability in pollinator dependent crop production. RST enable these applications
      to be scaled across much larger areas than is possible with field-based methods
      and will facilitate large scale ecological changes to be detected and monitored.
      We advocate greater use of RST to better understand interactions between pollination,
      plant health and yield spatial variation in pollinator dependent crops. This
      more holistic approach is necessary for decision-makers to improve strategies
      toward managing multiple land use types and ecosystem services.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5806","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,19]],"date-time":"2018-10-19T05:14:24Z","timestamp":1539926064000},"page":"e5806","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":13,"title":["Toward

      relationship between feeding ecology and sexual dimorphism is examined in a
      speciose South African monkey beetle clade. We test whether feeding and mating
      at a fixed site (embedding guild) is associated with greater levels of sexual
      dimorphism and possibly sexual selection than species using unpredictable feeding
      resources (non-embedding guild). Sexual dimorphism was measured using a point
      scoring system for hind leg and colour across the two feeding guilds for &gt;50%
      of the regional fauna. Quantification of hind leg dimorphism using a scoring
      system and allometric scaling were used to identify traits subject to sexual
      selection. Feeding guild had a significant effect on hind leg dimorphism, with
      embedders having high and non-embedders low scores. The sessile and defendable
      distribution of females on stable platform flowers may favour contests and associated
      hind leg weaponry. In contrast, degree of colour dimorphism between the sexes
      was not associated with any particular feeding guild, and may serve to reduce
      male conflict and combat. Embedder males had high proportions (\u223c76%) of
      species with positive allometric slopes for almost all hind leg traits. For
      male non-embedders, only \u223c37% of species showed positive scaling relationships.
      Phylogenetic data, in conjunction with behavioural data on the function of leg
      weaponry and visual signalling among males is needed to better understand the
      link between sexual dimorphism and sexual selection in the radiation of the
      monkey beetles.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4632","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,20]],"date-time":"2018-06-20T07:55:02Z","timestamp":1529481302000},"page":"e4632","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Feeding

      properly assess risk, an animal must focus its attention on relevant external
      stimuli; however, attention can be reallocated when distracting stimuli are
      present. This reallocation of attention may interfere with an individual\u2019s
      ability to effectively assess risk and may impede its response. Multiple stimuli
      presented together can have additive effects as distractors, and these include
      stimuli in different modalities. Although changes in noise and water flow are
      detectable by some bivalves, this has not been studied in the context of risk
      assessment or distraction. We experimentally exposed giant clams (<jats:italic>Tridacna
      maxima<\/jats:italic>) to changes in water particle movement through underwater
      sound (motorboat noise) and increased water flow to determine whether these
      stimuli, individually or together, modified risk assessment or caused distraction.
      We found that clams responded to sound, flow, and their combination by increasing
      frequency of mantle retractions (a potential anti-predator response) when exposed
      to a stimulus. Sound alone did not change risk assessment in either the latency
      to close or to reemerge following closure. However, when exposed to both stimuli
      simultaneously, clams increased their latency to close. We suggest that clams
      perceive sound and flow in an additive way, and are thus distracted. Interestingly,
      and uniquely, clams discriminate these multimodal stimuli through a single sensory
      modality. For sessile clams, anthropogenic noise is detectable, yet unavoidable,
      suggesting that they be especially vulnerable to marine noise pollution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10050","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]],"date-time":"2020-10-05T09:28:46Z","timestamp":1601890126000},"page":"e10050","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Are

      variations of the ichthyoplankton assemblage and its relationship with the environment
      were analyzed based on four seasonal surveys during 2012. Historical data was
      collected to be compared with results from previous years in order to indicate
      the seasonal and inter-annual variation of the ichthyoplankton assemblage in
      the Yangtze Estuary and the adjacent waters. A total of 3,688 individuals belonging
      to 5 orders, 9 families, and 15 species were collected. No samples were collected
      in the winter cruise. In 2012, all samples were separated into four ecotypes,
      which is comparable with the historical data from previous years. The <jats:italic>Engraulis
      japonicus<\/jats:italic> was the most abundant species of all teleost fishes.
      The <jats:italic>E. japonicus<\/jats:italic> was captured in every season and
      contributed the most to the abundance of ichthyoplankton, which was greater
      than that of previous years. This result may be due to the periodic fluctuations
      of <jats:italic>E. japonicus<\/jats:italic> or from the displacement of spawning
      grounds offshore for environmental reasons. The diversity indices of the assemblage
      were significantly different among seasons, with the number and abundance of
      the species peaking in the spring, while richness, evenness and diversity indices
      peaked in the autumn. The species richness of the ichthyoplankton varied from
      0.74 to 1.62, the Pielou evenness index varied from 0.10 to 0.49 and the Shannon\u2013Wiener
      index varied from 0.19 to 1.04. The results of CCA analysis showed that the
      major factors affecting the ichthyoplankton assemblage differed throughout the
      seasons. Chla was the key factor affecting the ichthyoplankton in 2012. These
      seasonal and inter-annual variations likely resulted from migrations associated
      with fish spawning as well as the environment. Compared with data from previous
      studies, the relationship between the assemblage structure of ichthyoplankton
      and corresponding environmental variables have undergone a decline.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6482","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,21]],"date-time":"2019-02-21T03:58:14Z","timestamp":1550721494000},"page":"e6482","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Seasonal

      systems play an important role in animal survival. Changes to these systems
      may be critical in evolution of species in new environments. Previous studies
      exploring the correlation between feeding ecology and <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
      evolution mainly focused on mammals and birds, and found that the relationship
      was complex. However, in reptiles, the correlation between <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
      evolution and dietary preferences is still unclear. Here, we attempted to explore
      this relationship in representative species of the major groups of reptiles
      (turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodilians), for which the genome information is
      known. We first predicted the functionality (intact, partial, or defective)
      of <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>, and then related it to the feeding preferences.
      As a result, we identified 11 <jats:italic>Tas1r1<\/jats:italic>, 12 <jats:italic>Tas1r2<\/jats:italic>,
      and 12 <jats:italic>Tas1r3<\/jats:italic> genes to be partial or intact and
      another 22 <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> genes to be absent or pseudogenized
      in the 19 reptiles. We found that, as it was revealed in some other vertebrate
      groups, no correlation existed between feeding ecology and <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
      evolution in reptiles: genomic prediction indicated that the <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic>
      genes possibly have been lost or pseudogenized in snakes, but in crocodylia
      and testudines <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> genes are either intact or
      partial, regardless of their feeding habits. Thus, we suggest that the driving
      force of <jats:italic>Tas1r<\/jats:italic> evolution in reptiles is complex,
      and the feeding habit of swallowing food whole without chewing or the absence
      of taste buds in certain species may account for the possible umami\/sweet perception
      loss. In addition, we propose that caution should be taken when predicting gene
      functionality from the publicly available genome database.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5570","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,24]],"date-time":"2018-08-24T07:53:33Z","timestamp":1535097213000},"page":"e5570","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Molecular

      is directly associated with formation of spatially distinct spawning aggregations

      of spatially explicit gear restrictions. Understanding the spatial ecology of
      Giant Sea Bass is a key part of efforts to assess contemporary threats such
      as commercial harvest and incidental catch by recreational fisheries. In this
      study, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize Giant Sea Bass space use in
      the La Jolla kelp forest using an acoustic array that encompasses two marine
      protected areas (MPAs) and heavily trafficked recreational fishing grounds.
      Five of the seven fish we tagged remained in the La Jolla array for at least
      6 months. Two fish were resident across multiple years, with one fish consistently
      detected for 4 years. Only one fish was detected in the broader network of regional
      acoustic receivers, moving north approximately 8 km to Del Mar. Most tagged
      fish had home ranges and core use areas indicating they spend considerable time
      outside MPAs, particularly in areas with high recreational fishing activity.
      During spawning season we detected fish less frequently in the La Jolla array
      and recorded higher movement rates. While the current MPA network in La Jolla
      by no means offers complete protection to this fish, it does appear to support
      long-term persistence of some individuals in a region of exceptionally high
