        science ontologies play an important role in Semantic Web. Given the diversity
        in fish species and the associated wealth of information, it is imperative
        to develop an ontology capable of linking and integrating this information
        in an automated fashion. As such, we introduce the Fish Ontology (FO), an
        automated classification architecture of existing fish taxa which provides
        taxonomic information on unknown fish based on metadata restrictions. It is
        designed to support knowledge discovery, provide semantic annotation of fish
        and fisheries resources, data integration, and information retrieval. Automated
        classification for unknown specimens is a unique feature that currently does
        not appear to exist in other known ontologies. Examples of automated classification
        for major groups of fish are demonstrated, showing the inferred information
        by introducing several restrictions at the species or specimen level. The
        current version of FO has 1,830 classes, includes widely used fisheries terminology,
        and models major aspects of fish taxonomy, grouping, and character. With more
        than 30,000 known fish species globally, the FO will be an indispensable tool
        for fish scientists and other interested\u00a0users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.3811","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]],"date-time":"2017-09-15T08:06:53Z","timestamp":1505462813000},"page":"e3811","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Fish

        visual surveys (UVSs) for monitoring fish communities are preferred over fishing
        surveys in certain habitats, such as rocky or coral reefs and seagrass beds
        and are the standard monitoring tool in many cases, especially in protected
        areas. However, despite their wide application there are potential biases,
        mainly due to imperfect detectability and the behavioral responses of fish
        to the observers.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>The
        performance of two methods of UVSs were compared to test whether they give
        similar results in terms of fish population density, occupancy, species richness,
        and community composition. Distance sampling (line transects) and plot sampling
        (strip transects) were conducted at 31 rocky reef sites in the Aegean Sea
        (Greece) using SCUBA diving.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>Line
        transects generated significantly higher values of occupancy, species richness,
        and total fish density compared to strip transects. For most species, density
        estimates differed significantly between the two sampling methods. For secretive
        species and species avoiding the observers, the line transect method yielded
        higher estimates, as it accounted for imperfect detectability and utilized
        a larger survey area compared to the strip transect method. On the other hand,
        large-scale spatial patterns of species composition were similar for both

        ecosystems are influenced simultaneously by multiple stressors. One important
        environmental stressor is aquatic pollution via wastewater treatment plant
        (WWTP) effluents. WWTP effluents may contribute to eutrophication or contain
        anthropogenic contaminants that directly and\/or indirectly influence aquatic
        wildlife. Both eutrophication and exposure to anthropogenic contaminants may
        affect the dynamics of fish-parasite systems. With this in mind, we studied
        the impact of WWTP effluents on infection of brown trout by the parasite <jats:italic>Tetracapsuloides
        bryosalmonae<\/jats:italic>, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease
        (PKD). PKD is associated with the long-term decline of wild brown trout (<jats:italic>Salmo
        trutta<\/jats:italic>) populations in Switzerland. We investigated PKD infection
        of brown trout at two adjacent sites (\u2248400 m apart) of a Swiss river.
        The sites are similar in terms of ecology except that one site receives WWTP
        effluents. We evaluated the hypothesis that fish inhabiting the effluent site
        will show greater susceptibility to PKD in terms of prevalence and disease
        outcome. We assessed susceptibility by (i) infection prevalence, (ii) parasite
        intensity, (iii) host health in terms of pathology, and (iv) estimated apparent
        survival rate. At different time points during the study, significant differences
        between sites concerning all measured parameters were found, thus providing
        evidence of the influence of effluents on parasitic infection of fish in our
        study system. However, from these findings we cannot determine if the effluent
        has a direct influence on the fish host via altering its ability to manage
        the parasite, or indirectly on the parasite or the invertebrate host via increasing
        bryozoa (the invertebrate host) reproduction. On a final note, the WWTP adhered
        to all national guidelines and the effluent only resulted in a minor water
        quality reduction assessed via standardized methods in this study. Thus, we
        provide evidence that even a subtle decrease in water quality, resulting in
        small-scale pollution can have consequences for wildlife.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5956","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]],"date-time":"2018-11-13T08:57:57Z","timestamp":1542099477000},"page":"e5956","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Do

        are of immense importance to Mediterranean countries, for protein, employment
        and livelihoods. Studies addressing the factors affecting fish price dynamics
        are of interest to examine their drivers as prices often dictate target fisheries.
        This study investigates fish market prices in relation to landings and fish
        sizes from T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s largest fish market in Istanbul as the study
        site. A total of 39 wild marine taxa were examined for their landed catch
        (kg) and average prices (per unit\/TRY) from 2006 to 2019. We found fish prices
        increased from small pelagic to medium pelagic to demersal fish. GAM model
        results for inter-species tests showed a strong positive effect of local maximum
        length (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01) and a weaker positive
        effect of trophic level and vulnerability (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.1)
        on fish market price, but that landings amounts have no significant effect
        as a single predictor. Monthly price variations of bluefish and bonito were
        completely different than other species dynamics, as the last substantial
        commercial medium pelagic fish species left; highest monthly prices were related
        to the highest monthly landings for bonito and for the non-closure period
        for bluefish. Market prices as economic indicators for fisheries may have
        the potential to reveal ecosystem variations as well as socioeconomic drivers.
        Databases including extensive data for key fish sales centers can be used
        to help understand fishery dynamics from an ecosystem perspective, especially
        for data-poor regions like T\u00fcrkiye.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15141","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,4]],"date-time":"2023-04-04T07:16:51Z","timestamp":1680592611000},"page":"e15141","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Bio-economic

        grazing strongly controls periphyton biomass. The question therefore arises
        whether benthic grazing could be used as a tool to reduce excessive growth
        of periphyton in nutrient-enriched rivers. Although benthic invertebrate grazers
        reduce the growth of periphyton, this is highly context dependent. Here we
        assessed whether the only obligate herbivorous fish in European rivers, the
        common nase (<jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus<\/jats:italic>L.), is able to
        reduce periphyton biomass in a eutrophic river. We conducted three consecutive<jats:italic>in
        situ<\/jats:italic>experiments at low, intermediate and high densities of
        nase in the river using standard tiles on the river bottom naturally covered
        with periphyton that were accessible to fish and tiles that excluded fish
        foraging with electric exclosures. The biomass of benthic invertebrate grazers
        was very low relative to nase. We hypothesised that nase would reduce periphyton
        biomass on accessible tiles and therefore expected higher periphyton biomass
        on the exclosure tiles, at least at intermediate and high densities of nase
        in the river. Contrary to our expectation, the impact of fish grazing was
        low even at high fish density, as judged by the significantly lower chlorophyll<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic>concentration
        on exclosure tiles even though the ash-free dry mass on accessible and exclosure
        tiles did not differ. The lower chlorophyll<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic>concentrations
        on exclosure tiles might be explained by a higher biomass of invertebrate
        grazers on the exclosure tiles, which would indicate that the effect of invertebrate
        grazers was stronger than that of herbivorous fish grazers. The high biomass
        of invertebrate grazers on exclosure tiles likely arose from the exclusion
        of zoobenthivorous fish, which occur in the river at high densities. The results
        of our small-scale experiments suggested that cascading top-down effects of
        zoobenthivorous fish have a higher impact on periphyton biomass than direct
        effects of herbivorous nase.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4381","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,14]],"date-time":"2018-02-14T08:57:56Z","timestamp":1518598676000},"page":"e4381","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Benthic

        marine protected areas (MUMPAs) are a commonly applied tool for marine conservation
        in developing countries, particularly where large no-take reserves are not
        socially or politically feasible. Although MUMPAs have produced benefits around
        the world, the persistence of moderate fishing pressure reduces the likelihood
        of achieving the primary objective of these areas, which is the conservation
        of ecosystems. In this study we used traditional and functional metrics to
        evaluate how fish assemblages changed through time in a MUMPA, including shifts
        in species responses and in ecological processes. We conducted visual censuses
        of fishes at Esp\u00edritu Santo Island, M\u00e9xico (MUMPA;<jats:italic>N<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a0320;
        24\u00b0N, 110\u00b0W) from 2005 to 2017 to assess fish richness, size-distribution
        and density. Three functional indices were calculated using six traits (size,
        mobility, period of activity, aggregation, position in water column and diet):
        functional richness (volume occupied by species), dispersion (complementarity
        between species) and originality (inverse of functional redundancy). We compared
        fish diversity among three management zone types (sustainable fishing, traditional
        fishing and no-take zones), through a 13-year period, assessing which species
        increased or decreased in occurrence, density, and biomass, and how indices
        respond over time. Despite a general increase in biomass and stability in
        density and originality, we detected a reduction in fish biodiversity in the
        form of declines in species and functional richness, which could imply the
        risk of local extinction and decrease in certain ecosystem processes. In addition,
        changes in functional dispersion showed that some functions are losing representation
        through time. Although no single cause is apparent, such factors as competitive
        interactions, habitat loss and persistence of fishing pressure potentially
        explain these decreases. The rise in biomass was associated with a general
        increase in the average size, rather than increased biomass of commercial
        species, as the latter remained stable during the study period. Expansion
        of no-take areas, enforcement of fishing regulations, and surveillance in
        core zones, should be implemented to reverse the decline in particular species
        and to promote conservation of fish functional diversity in this MUMPA.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8885","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,9]],"date-time":"2020-04-09T07:39:17Z","timestamp":1586417957000},"page":"e8885","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Reduced

        is a common method to monitor environmental change in river ecosystems, a
        key advantage of biomonitoring over snap-shot physicochemical monitoring is
        that it provides a more stable, long-term insight into change that is also
        effects-based. In New Zealand, the main biomonitoring method is a macroinvertebrate
        sensitivity scoring index, with little established methods available for biomonitoring
        of fish. This study models the contemporary distribution of common freshwater
        fish and then uses those models to predict freshwater fish assemblages for
        each river reach under reference conditions. Comparison of current fish assemblages
        with those predicted in reference conditions (as observed\/expected (O\/E)
        ratios) may provide a suitable option for freshwater fish biomonitoring. Most
        of the fish communities throughout the central North Island and lower reaches
        show substantial deviation from the modelled reference community. Most of
        this deviation is explained by nutrient enrichment, followed by downstream
        barriers (i.e. dams) and loss of riparian vegetation. The presence of modelled
        introduced species had relatively little impact on the presence of the modelled
        native fish. The maps of O\/E fish assemblage may provide a rapid way to identify
        potential restoration sites.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.4890","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,28]],"date-time":"2018-05-28T07:27:25Z","timestamp":1527492445000},"page":"e4890","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Predicting

        study assessed the feeding habits of four-finger threadfin fish, <jats:italic>Eleutheronema
        tetradactylum<\/jats:italic>, and its diet relationship with other fish species
        in the tropics. Fish samples were collected from four locations along the
        coastal regions of Thailand. A whole year field sampling event was conducted
        to investigate the diet relationship of threadfin fish with other ten co-existing
        fish species in Pattani Bay during January 2021 and January 2022. <jats:italic>E.
        tetradactylum<\/jats:italic> was an active and specific predator with significant
        diet shift during ontogeny. Specifically, the juvenile fish fed largely on
        zooplankton especially <jats:italic>Acetes<\/jats:italic>\/shrimp postlarvae,
        and small sized-fish fed on penaeid shrimps, while medium and large-sized
        fish shifted their diets to a combination of penaeid shrimp, fish and squid.
        Size and sex of fish as well as site of collection significantly affected
        gut fullness index and average number of food type (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05).
        Transitional sex fish predated almost entirely on other fishes (87.2%), whereas
        male and female fish fed mainly on penaeid shrimp (66.5%) and other fish (51.3%),
        respectively. Fish size and mouth opening controlled the size of prey, with
        the larger fish with larger mouth-opening fed primarily on the larger size
        of prey. Moreover, <jats:italic>E. tetradactylum<\/jats:italic> shared its
        diets inclusively with <jats:italic>Epinephelus coioides, Johnius belangerii,

        the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task is a widely used experimental method
        for studying divided attention, tracking objects in the real world usually
        looks different. For example, in the real world, objects are usually clearly
        distinguishable from each other and also possess different movement patterns.
        One such case is tracking groups of creatures, such as tracking fish in an
        aquarium. We used movies of fish in an aquarium and measured general tracking
        performance in this task (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we compared tracking
        accuracy within-subjects in fish tracking, tracking typical MOT stimuli, and
        in a third condition using standard MOT uniform objects which possessed movement
        patterns similar to the real fish. This third condition was added to further
        examine the impact of different motion characteristics on tracking performance.
        Results within a Bayesian framework showed that tracking real fish shares
        similarities with tracking simple objects in a typical laboratory MOT task.
        Furthermore, we observed a close relationship between performance in both
        laboratory MOT tasks (typical and fish-like) and real fish tracking, suggesting
        that the commonly used laboratory MOT task possesses a good level of ecological
        validity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.13031","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,3]],"date-time":"2022-03-03T08:18:11Z","timestamp":1646295491000},"page":"e13031","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Tracking

        presence of microplastics (MPs) in processed seafood is a growing concern.
        In this study, 33 different canned fish brands belonging to seven producers
        were purchased from the Turkish market and investigated. MPs composition,
        possible sources, and potential intake were assessed. Light microscopy was
        used to quantify potential MPs, and micro-Raman microscopy was used to identify
        the polymer types. The results showed that all the samples had at least one
        MPs particle, and fragments were the most abundant (57.3%) shape of MPs. Polyolefin
        (21.88%) was the most common polymer type. The results showed that packaging
        and the production processes are the main possible sources of MPs. Human intake
        estimation risk is relatively lower since canned fish consumption is relatively
        low. The findings suggest that the risk related to MPs in canned fish should
        be considered one of the components of food safety management systems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14627","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,18]],"date-time":"2023-01-18T10:02:15Z","timestamp":1674036135000},"page":"e14627","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Microplastic

        behaviour, as fascinating as it is unclear, has lately drawn the attention
        of numerous researchers. While most of the authors focused their work on a
        mechanistic approach to the matter of schooling, this study explores the issue
        from a population point of view. Present camera observation study on the fish
        community carried out in the epipelagic habitat of a European temperate reservoir
        in the Czech Republic explored the relationship between density and aggregative
        features of predominantly cyprinid fish stock. Results demonstrated that schooling
        behaviour is triggered by the \u2018critical density\u2019 of fish in the
        habitat. School size as well as counts of schools and proportion of schooling
        individuals increased with the density of fish. Counts of clusters (observed
        units in time, including singletons, pairs and schools) and cluster size,
        on the other hand, showed a slowing tendency to increase. The slower increase
        implies the tendency of fish for not being frequent but rather to create larger
        groups. Altogether, our findings suggest that fish density is a triggering
        factor in the formation of large fish schools. As the tendency of cyprinid
        species for school formation could be an evolutional advantage responsible
        for dominance in later succession phases of water bodies, we suggest that
        more in situ studies should be encouraged for the proper understanding of
        the ecological interactions that drive the structure of aquatic ecosystems
        and for ensuring unbiased assessment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6378","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,4]],"date-time":"2019-02-04T09:11:45Z","timestamp":1549271505000},"page":"e6378","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["Density

        of soft tissue, cells and original biomolecular constituents preserved in
        fossil vertebrates have increased greatly in recent years. Here we report
        preservation of \u2018skin\u2019 with chemical and molecular characterization
        from a three-dimensionally preserved caudal portion of an aspidorhynchid Cretaceous
        fish from the equatorial Barremian of Colombia, increasing the number of localities
        for which exceptional preservation is known. We applied several analytical
        techniques including SEM-EDS, FTIR and ToF-SIMS to characterize the micromorphology
        and molecular and elemental composition of this fossil. Here, we show that
        the fossilized \u2018skin\u2019 exhibits similarities with those from extant
        fish, including the wrinkles after suffering compression stress and flexibility,
        as well as architectural and tissue aspects of the two main layers (epidermis
        and dermis). This similarity extends also to the molecular level, with the
        demonstrated preservation of potential residues of original proteins not consistent
        with a bacterial source. Our results show a potential preservation mechanism
        where scales may have acted as an external barrier and together with an internal
        phosphate layer resulting from the degradation of the dermis itself creating
        an encapsulated environment for the integument.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.9479","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]],"date-time":"2020-07-08T08:50:08Z","timestamp":1594198208000},"page":"e9479","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Exceptionally

        addition to hypopigmentation of the skin and red iris colouration, albino
        animals also display distinct physiological and behavioural alterations. However,
        information on the social interactions of albino animals is rare and has mostly
        been limited to specially bred strains of albino rodents and animals from
        unique environments in caves. Differentiating between the effects of albinism
        and domestication on behaviour in rodents can be difficult, and social behaviour
        in cave fish changes according to species-specific adaptations to conditions
        of permanent darkness. The agonistic behaviours of albino offspring of pigmented
        parents have yet to be described. In this study, we observed agonistic behaviour
        in albino and pigmented juvenile<jats:italic>Silurus glanis<\/jats:italic>catfish.
        We found that the total number of aggressive interactions was lower in albinos
        than in pigmented catfish. The distance between conspecifics was also analysed,
        and albinos showed a tendency towards greater separation from their same-coloured
        conspecifics compared with pigmented catfish. These results demonstrate that
        albinism can be associated with lower aggressiveness and with reduced shoaling
        behaviour preference, as demonstrated by a tendency towards greater separation
        of albinos from conspecifics.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.1937","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]],"date-time":"2016-04-18T08:39:17Z","timestamp":1460968757000},"page":"e1937","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":["How

        the distribution of most of the species is poorly known, conservationists
        use surrogates to help maximize the representation level of all species. Historically,
        species richness has been used to calculate the importance of priority areas
        for conservation, but several studies revealed sites with high species richness
        often fail to determine the smallest number of sites that will protect the
        highest number of species. Rarity, however, has played a prominent role in
        safeguarding planning units. While the performance of rarity has been previously
        assessed in terrestrial systems, we tested the hypothesis that rarity of a
        site can be used as a measure of the importance of a site to a conservation
        network in marine ecosystems. We used the presence data (at a 1-degree resolution)
        to calculate five rarity indices of fish diversity at a global extent and
        compared the results to those obtained by using species richness and site
        complementarity. Our objectives were to: (1) determine if rarity indices can
        be used as surrogates of fish biodiversity by representing the highest number
        of species in the smallest number of sites; and (2) determine if the effectiveness
        of these indices to represent fish biodiversity is impacted by the metric
        used to define rarity. Results indicate that rarity could be an effective
        surrogate for marine fishes, as most results showed a mean of 100% effectiveness.
        In the context of marine biodiversity conservation, results show that rarity
        indices could be considered affordable and feasible surrogates of species
        representation, with the most significant benefit to those areas of the world
        that are in most need to access alternative tools. Results also open a new
        area of collaboration between biogeography and marine conservation biology
        since planners can use biogeographical patterns of rarity to enhance the performance
        of the current protected area network.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.8373","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,10]],"date-time":"2020-02-10T09:11:17Z","timestamp":1581325877000},"page":"e8373","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["The

        Upper Mississippian Bluefield Formation of the Mauch Chunk Group in southeastern
        West Virginia is known for its preservation of a variety of invertebrate taxa
        and early tetrapod trackways, but no lower actinopterygian remains have been
        formally described from these Carboniferous rocks. Here, the first lower actinopterygian
        fish is described from the Bluefield Formation of West Virginia. This fish
        is represented by a nearly complete articulated specimen with a three-dimensional
        snout and an unobstructed view of the gular and branchiostegal region. This
        new taxon is defined by a unique set of characters, which include features
        of the snout, circumorbital series, cheek, and operculo-gular region. These
        features make this fish different and distinct from previously described Carboniferous
        fishes. Some of the morphological features of note include the presence of
        a distinct lacrimal, premaxillary, ventral rostral and dorsal rostral bones,
        a narrow infraorbital ventral to the orbit, and a large crescent shaped infraorbital
        that contacts a single dermosphenotic. There is an anteriorly inclined hatchet-shaped
        preoperculum and six small suborbital bones anterior to the expanded region
        of this bone that filling the space between the preoperculum, dermosphenotic,
        and infraorbital. Posterior to the preoperculum, there is a single wedge-shaped
        dermohyal and a series of three rectangular anteopercular bones. The anteopercular
        bones extend halfway down the anterior border of the rectangular operculum.
        A median gular, two pairs of lateral gulars, and at least eight branchiostegal
        rays are present. The heterocercal caudal fin is deeply cleft and inequilobate.
        The scales have pectinated posterior margins and bear diagonal ridges of ganoine.
        The description of this new taxon represents the first actinopterygian and
        the first vertebrate body fossil described from the Bluefield Formation and
        the second actinopterygian taxon described from the Mauch Chunk Group in West
        Virginia.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5533","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,29]],"date-time":"2018-08-29T12:20:48Z","timestamp":1535545248000},"page":"e5533","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["A

        studies have suggested that seagrass beds provide nursery habitats for juvenile
        fish in both tropical and subtropical regions. Most of these previous studies
        applied a landscape-scale perspective, in which seagrass beds and coral reefs
        are treated as independent, homogenous habitats. However, this perspective
        might overlook the microhabitat-scale perspective within the habitats, for
        example, the possibility that small-sized hard substrates (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>.,
        coral colonies) within seagrass beds might serve as fish nurseries. The present
        study aimed to examine the effects of the presence of microhabitats (small-sized
        coral colonies) within seagrass beds on the structure of fish assemblages.
        Fieldwork was conducted at Urasoko Bay, Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan. Four
        habitat zones were selected: (1) seagrass bed with presence of massive coral
        colonies (SGCO), (2) seagrass bed without coral colonies (SG), (3) sandy bottom
        (without seagrass vegetation) with massive coral colonies (CO), and (4) sandy
        bottom without seagrass vegetation or coral colonies (SA). Six 20 m \u00d7
        2 m line transects were established and monthly underwater observations were
        conducted between June and October in 2018 and 2019. A cluster analysis, analysis
        of similarity, and principal component analysis revealed that the fish assemblage
        at SGCO was significantly different from the other three habitat zones. This
        was because some fish species (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., <jats:italic>Ostorhinchusishigakiensis<\/jats:italic>
        and <jats:italic>Lutjanus gibbus<\/jats:italic>) were almost exclusively present
        at SGCO and rarely seen at CO, SG, and SA. Most individual fish belonging
        to these species were found on coral colonies at SGCO, suggesting that the
        co-occurrence of seagrass vegetation and coral colonies is essential for the
        habitats of these fish species. Although other fish species present at SGCO
        were also found at SG, three species, <jats:italic>Parupeneus barberinus<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>Stethojulis strigiventer<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Lethrinus
        atkinsoni<\/jats:italic>, were more abundant at SGCO with some found on coral
        colonies in this habitat zone. Several fish species that occurred at both
        SGCO and CO (<jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>., <jats:italic>Ostorhinchus properuptus<\/jats:italic>,
        <jats:italic>Cheilodispterus quinquelineatus<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Chrysiptera
        cyanea<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>Pomacentrus chrysurus<\/jats:italic>)
        were more abundant or showed a greater size range at SGCO, suggesting greater
        survival rates in this habitat zone because of the co-occurrence of seagrass
        vegetation and coral colonies. This study demonstrated the existence of a
        unique fish assemblage structure at SGCO. Although the adoption of a landscape-scale
        perspective (three-dimensional structure of the vegetation) is necessary,
        a microhabitat-scale perspective that includes the presence of small hard
        substrates should also be considered to accurately evaluate the nursery function
        of seagrass beds.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14466","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,23]],"date-time":"2022-11-23T08:41:33Z","timestamp":1669192893000},"page":"e14466","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Co-occurrence
