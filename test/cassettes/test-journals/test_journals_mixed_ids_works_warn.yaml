        on a long-term development of the selected Slovak cultural landscape types
        (plains, basins, uplands, highlands, and mountains) in approx. 200 years,
        which shaped the main land use features as well as on the recent transformation
        trends. The land use development analyses showed that from a long term view
        perspective several distinct periods can be distinguished. Each of these periods
        was characteristic for certain land use changes depending both on the landscape
        character or the socioeconomic situation. The recent trends as land use intensification
        (intense agriculture, sub-urbanisation, industrial construction) or land use
        extensification (agricultural land overgrowing) are considered to be common
        for the entire Slovak territory. Special transformation trends reflect more
        local conditions, human needs and preferences (construction of water reservoirs,
        wind calamities or tourism resorts) and though they are spatially isolated
        and small they influence the majority of Slovak inhabitants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0018-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"41-55","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":17,"title":["Transformation

        we still got time for sustainability and reasonable application of ideas of
        sustainable development? It has been just over twenty years since the Brundtland
        Commission Report but, taken as an axiological term; sustainable development
        resonates with older historical horizons. At the heart of a long running history
        we are beginning to articulate more or less sustaining relationships between
        man and nature. We have described the (human) needs in the environmental,
        economic and social dimension of sustainable development to show some amazing
        shift in perception of sustainable development from local to global level.
        We are convinced that historical lesson of sustainable development shows there
        is no more time for sustainability, but time for SOStainability. Our proposed
        S-O-S in SOStainability means Save Our Sustainability! SOStainability represents

        (i.e. site conditions) were developed based on Kolesnikov''s topogenetic classification

        applied using geographic information system (GIS) \"Forests of Central Siberia\".
        Based on this algorithm, Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery, SRTM-3- DEM, and
        field data were processed for the Angara test site. The resulting maps include
        two polygonal vector layers: one is forest regeneration stages (stand types)
        and the other is forest succession series (forest types) in a range of site
        conditions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0033-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:15:57Z","timestamp":1344590157000},"page":"42-54","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["A

        aim of this paper is to describe the species biodiversity of important woody
        species in the riparian zone of wide floodplains in the Protected Landscape
        Area (PLA) Pood\u0159\u00ed (Central Europe, Czech Republic). The analysis
        of growth in terms of particular species was carried out to find out their
        growth potential. Another task was to evaluate the diversity and health condition
        of all trees and to determine the occurrence frequency of important woody
        species (IWS) in particular geobiocoene type groups of wide alluvial plains.
        The tree classification pyramid (veteran-representative-successor-expectant)
        was built up to provide the sufficient number of diverse IWS in the area.
        In total, 3,419 IWS were mapped in the whole area of the PLA Pood\u0159\u00ed
        (81.5 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>). In wide alluvial plains, the <jats:italic>Ulmi-fraxineta
        carpini sup.<\/jats:italic> geobiocoene type group (GTG) shows the highest
        diversity. According to the surveys carried out in the area under investigation
        it is evident that there are a lot of IWS here deserving protection and the
        proposal of the appropriate management, which should be represented by the
        pyramid mentioned above. The pyramid would provide protection and care for
        the registered trees to reach a respectable age and maximum dimensions. It
        is necessary to preserve the species spectrum of the IWS to maintain the gene
        pool of initial populations and biodiversity in landscape. Some species exceed
        growth parameters of the same species at other floodplain sites in the Czech
        Republic and even in Europe.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0014-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"57-75","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Important

        in a Rural Landscape North of Dresden (Saxony))<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The
        precautionary principle is more and more incorporated into national law and
        decision-making on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
        In the coherent European network of protected areas Natura 2000, the precautionary
        principle finds expression in the obligation to provide favourable conditions
        for the long-term survival of species and habitats, especially of the priority
        ones listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.
        After describing principles, structure, implementation and procedures of this
        rather new instrument for nature conservation using the example of one of
        the various Natura 2000 areas in Saxony (Germany), opportunities and problems
        for biodiversity conservation are outlined with particular regard for the
        situation in an agricultural landscape. Special attention is given to the
        following questions: requirements of and actual threats to the target species
        (the butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea nausithous<\/jats:italic>), legal means
        and economic incentives for suitable measures, the management plan, and the
        role of stakeholders. It turns out that Natura 2000 could be an effective
        tool to advance nature conservation, and with special regard to the precautionary
        principle. Every effort is necessary to gain more public acceptance of Natura
        2000, as well as to improve scientific knowledge concerning species and habitats
        under protection.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0002-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:33Z","timestamp":1344590013000},"page":"14-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Adopting

        and Landscapes - A Critical Comparative Appraisal<\/jats:title><jats:p>Ecosystems
        and landscapes are the two major spatial units for ecological research and
        practice, but their definitions and meanings are vague and ambiguous. Examining
        critically the meaning and complexity of both terms from a holistic landscape
        ecological systems view, the confusing applications of the ecosystem concept
        could be avoided by conceiving ecosystems as functional interacting systems,
        characterized for the flow of energy, matter and information between organisms
        and their abiotic environment. As functional systems they are intangible with
        vaguely defined borders. On the other hand, landscapes should be recognized
        as tangible, spatially and temporally well defined ecological systems of closely
        interwoven natural and cultural entities of the Total Human Ecosystem. Ranging
        from the smallest discernable landscape cell or ecotope to the global ecosphere,
        they serve as the spatial and functional matrix and living space for all organisms,
        including humans, their populations and their ecosystems. Both are medium-numbered
        complex ecological systems. However, the organized complexity of ecosystems
        is based solely on the monodimensional complexity of material processes of
        flow of energy\/matter and biophysical information. But the organized complexity
        of landscapes is multidimensional and multifunctional, dealing not only with
        the functional dimensions of natural bio-ecological processes and the natural
        biophysical information, but also with the cognitive mental and perceptual
        dimensions, transmitted by cultural information and expressed in the closely
        interwoven natural and cultural landscape.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0024-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"64-81","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Ecosystem

        mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection
        are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically
        important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical
        swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain
        the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial
        cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both
        Shimen and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries
        of the control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355,
        and 3,327,493 respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and
        CSFV-Shimen groups, 644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
        were confirmed in the three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that
        many of these DEGs were enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated
        proteolysis, cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where
        the processes differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further
        elucidate important mechanisms related to the differential infection by the
        CSFV Shimen and C strains, we identified four possible profiles to assess
        the significantly expressed genes only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO
        analysis showed that infection with CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed \u2018RNA
        splicing\u2019 of SUVEC, resulting in differential \u2018gene expression\u2019
        in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identified as a significant
        response regulator contributed to impact on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen.
        This computational study suggests that CSFV of differing virulence could induce
        alterations in RNA splicing regulation in the host cell to change cell metabolism,
        resulting in acute haemorrhage and pathological damage or infectious tolerance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2113","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,8]],"date-time":"2016-06-08T06:26:39Z","timestamp":1465367199000},"page":"e2113","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Different

        and Objective<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Docker is a light containerization program
        that shows almost the same performance as a local environment. Recently, many
        bioinformatics tools have been distributed as Docker images that include complex
        settings such as libraries, configurations, and data if needed, as well as
        the actual tools. Users can simply download and run them without making the
        effort to compile and configure them, and can obtain reproducible results.
        In spite of these advantages, several problems remain. First, there is a lack
        of clear standards for distribution of Docker images, and the Docker Hub often
        provides multiple images with the same objective but different uses. For these
        reasons, it can be difficult for users to learn how to select and use them.
        Second, Docker images are often not suitable as a component of a pipeline,
        because many of them include big data. Moreover, a group of users can have
        difficulties when sharing a pipeline composed of Docker images. Users of a
        group may modify scripts or use different versions of the data, which causes
        inconsistent results.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods
        and Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>To handle the problems described above,
        we developed a Java web application, DockerBIO, which provides reliable, verified,
        light-weight Docker images for various bioinformatics tools and for various
        kinds of reference data. With DockerBIO, users can easily build a pipeline
        with tools and data registered at DockerBIO, and if necessary, users can easily
        register new tools or data. Built pipelines are registered in DockerBIO, which
        provides an efficient running environment for the pipelines registered at
        DockerBIO. This enables user groups to run their pipelines without expending
        much effort to copy and modify them.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5954","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,27]],"date-time":"2018-11-27T09:06:46Z","timestamp":1543309606000},"page":"e5954","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["DockerBIO:

        e.g., in sea urchins or mollusks, includes the assembly of mesoscopic superstructures
        from inorganic crystalline components and biopolymers. The resulting mesocrystals
        inspire biophysicists and material scientists alike, because of their extraordinary
        physical properties. Current efforts to replicate mesocrystal synthesis <jats:italic>in
        vitro<\/jats:italic> require understanding the principles of their self-assembly
        <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic>. One question, not addressed so far, is
        whether intracellular crystals of proteins can assemble with biopolymers into
        functional mesocrystal-like structures. During our electron microscopy studies
        into <jats:italic>Artemia franciscana<\/jats:italic> (Crustacea: Branchiopoda),
        we found initial evidence of such proteinaceous mesostructures.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>EM
        preparations with high-pressure freezing and accelerated freeze substitution
        revealed an extraordinary intracellular source of mesostructured inclusions
        in both the cyto-and nucleoplasm of the epidermal lining of ovisacs of <jats:italic>A.
        franciscana<\/jats:italic>. Confocal reflection microscopy not only confirmed
        our finding; it also revealed reflective, light dispersing activity of these
        flake-like structures, their positioning and orientation with respect to the
        ovisac inside. Both the striation of alternating electron dense and electron-lucent
        components and the sharp edges of the flakes indicate self-assembly of material
        of yet unknown origin under supposed participation of crystallization. However,
        selected area electron diffraction could not verify the status of crystallization.
        Energy dispersive X-ray analysis measured a marked increase in nitrogen within
        the flake-like inclusion, and the almost complete absence of elements that
        are typically involved in inorganic crystallization. This rise in nitrogen
        could possibility be related to higher package density of proteins, achieved
        by mesostructure assembly.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The
        ovisac lining of <jats:italic>A. franciscana<\/jats:italic> is endowed with
        numerous mesostructured inclusions that have not been previously reported.
        We hypothesize that their self-assembly was from proteinaceous polycrystalline
        units and carbohydrates. These mesostructured flakes displayed active optical
        properties, as an umbrella-like, reflective cover of the ovisac, which suggests
        a functional role in the reproduction of <jats:italic>A.\u00a0franciscana<\/jats:italic>.
        In turn, studies into ovisac mesostructured inclusions could help to optimizing
        rearing <jats:italic>Artemia<\/jats:italic> as feed for fish farming. We propose
        <jats:italic>Artemia<\/jats:italic> ovisacs as an <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic>

        malnutrition remains a severe problem in ruminant production and can increase
        susceptibility to infection, especially during the growth stage. This study
        aimed to explore substituting soybean meal with corn on activation of the
        TLR pathway and potential impact on immune response bias towards Type 1 or
        Type 2 using growing female goats as experimental animals.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Twenty-four
        Xiangdong black goats (initial BW = 19.83 \u00b1 0.53 kg, about 8 \u00b1 0.3
        months old) were selected and randomly divided into the corn-soybean meal
        basal diet group (CON, 10.77% protein) and replacing soybean meal with 100%
        of corn group (CRS, 5.52% protein). EDTA whole blood and serum samples were
        collected prior to slaughter for determinations of blood cell counts, anti-inflammatory
        cytokines and antibodies. The duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon tissues were
        collected after formal trial to study the effect of CRS diet on the expression
        of TLR4 pathway.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Our
        results showed CRS diet did not induce a significant change in immune function,
        as evidenced by the observations that white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil (Neu),
        lymphocyte (Lym), monocyte (Mon), eosinophil (Eos), interleukin-4 (IL-4),
        IL-5, IL-13, immunoglobin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels in serum were similar
        between the two groups. RT-PCR results showed the expression of tumor necrosis
        factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and interferon-\u03b2
        (IFN-\u03b2) (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) were up-regulated in
        the colon of goats in the CRS group. No differences in the expression of myeloid
        differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor-like protein (TIRAP), IL-1 receptor\u2013associated
        kinase 1 (IRAK1), TNF receptor related factor 6 (TRAF6), NF-kappa B (NF-\u03baB),
        mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or activator protein-1 (AP-1) in
        the TLR4\/MyD88 dependent pathway were observed between the two groups for
        any of the tested tissue. However, the expression of NF-\u03baB activator
        (TANK) binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in TLR4\/MyD88 independent pathway was up-regulated
        in the duodenum and colon (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01), and the
        expression of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) was up-regulated (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>

        results suggested that the CRS diet failed to induce a significant change
        in innate immunity and adaptive immunity in growing goats. However, the up-regulated
        TBK1 and IRF3 in the colon from the CRS goats suggests that the CRS diet may
        induce the expression of Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory
        response through a TLR4-MyD88-independent pathway, and the colon may be the
        easiest targeted section in the intestinal tract.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12910","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]],"date-time":"2022-02-07T08:31:57Z","timestamp":1644222717000},"page":"e12910","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects

        degradation is a well-documented trend, but the spread of mangroves within
        the Siangshan Wetland in Hsinchu, Taiwan, runs contrary to that trend. The
        spread of mangroves changes the structure and functions of habitats for benthic
        organisms, causes infilling of estuaries and flooding and creates breeding
        grounds for small black mosquitoes. A large-scale mangrove-removal project
        was undertaken by the Hsinchu City Government from October 2015 to March 2016.
        They also investigated the consequences of mangrove removal on benthic organisms
        and adjacent habitats from October 2015 to September 2016, and the density,
        species count, Shannon\u2013Wiener index (<jats:italic>H<\/jats:italic>\u2032),
        and Pielou\u2019s evenness index (<jats:italic>J<\/jats:italic>\u2032) of
        the mangrove and non-mangrove regions were compared. In this study, we used
        satellite telemetry images to monitor fluctuations in mangrove density from
        2006 to 2016. The non-mangrove region exhibited more variations than the mangrove
        region. After mangrove removal, species returned to their original habitats
        and noteworthy biological values significantly increased in the mangrove regions.
        This study presents evidence to argue that mangrove removal benefits benthic
        organisms. The results indicate that mangrove removal can be an appropriate
        habitat rehabilitation strategy for benthic organisms. The ecological findings
        of this study can inform coastal managers or other officials who seek to steward
        mangrove biomass.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5670","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,4]],"date-time":"2018-10-04T14:47:46Z","timestamp":1538664466000},"page":"e5670","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Effects

        are one of the most commonly transformed aquatic ecosystems. Most papers present
        significantly negative effects of activities such as dredging or channel regulation
        on the ecological status of rivers. The purpose of this work was to compare
        the response of various groups of invertebrates (Mollusca, Hydrachnidia, Odonata,
        Heteroptera, Coleoptera and Trichoptera) to an intervention involving dredging
        in conjunction with the removal of riparian vegetation. Habitat diversity
        increased after the dredging, and more individuals and species were caught
        than before the dredging. The increase in habitat diversity after the dredging
        translated into an increase in the species diversity of most investigated
        groups. Individual groups of invertebrates showed varied responses to the
        dredging, depending on the role of the terrestrial phase in their life cycle:
        the greater the role of the terrestrial phase in the life cycle, the more
        the group was affected by changes in the terrestrial environment following
        the intervention. In consequence, the intervention had the greatest negative
        impact on insects, and among these, on adult Odonata. The following conclusions
        can be drawn: (1) Dredging can benefit a previously anthropogenically transformed
        river ecosystem by increasing habitat diversity; (2) Odonata are particularly
        useful for assessing the impact of this type of intervention on invertebrate
        communities. They can be considered good indicators of habitat disturbances
        in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12224","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]],"date-time":"2021-09-29T09:01:22Z","timestamp":1632906082000},"page":"e12224","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Anthropogenic

        diet that is high in sugar and fat is a precursor to various chronic diseases,
        especially hyperlipidemia. Patients with hyperlipidemia have increased levels
        of plasma free fatty acids and an ectopic accumulation of lipids. The kidney
        is one of the main organs affected by this disease and, recently, there have
        been more studies conducted on renal injury caused by hyperlipidemia. The
        main pathological mechanism is closely related to renal lipotoxicity. However,
        in different kidney cells, the reaction mechanism varies due to the different
        affinities of the lipid receptors. At present, it is believed that in addition
        to lipotoxicity, hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury is also closely related
        to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammatory reactions,
        which are the result of multiple factors. Exercise plays an important role
        in the prevention of various chronic diseases and recently emerging researches
        indicated its positive effects to renal injury caused by hyperlipidemia. However,
        there are few studies summarizing the effects of exercise on this disease
        and the specific mechanisms need to be further explored. This article summarizes
        the mechanisms of hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury at the cellular level
        and discusses the ways in which exercise may regulate it. The results provide
        theoretical support and novel approaches for identifying the intervention
        target to treat hyperlipidemia induced-renal injury.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.15435","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,1]],"date-time":"2023-06-01T07:52:14Z","timestamp":1685605934000},"page":"e15435","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        collected fasting plasma from LSCC patients and healthy volunteers, as well

        detection of amino acid levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
        We used overall analysis and multivariate statistical analysis to screen out
        the statistically significant differential amino acids in the plasma and tissue
        samples, conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the
        differential amino acids to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the
        differential amino acids, and finally determined the diagnostic value of amino
        acids for laryngeal cancer. Additionally, we identified amino acids in the
        plasma and tissue samples that are valuable for the early diagnosis of laryngeal

        LSCC. According to the TNM staging system, phenylalanine (Phe) and isoleucine
        (Ile) were screened out in the plasma of LSCC patients at early (I and II)
        and advanced (III and IV) stages; ornithine hydrochloride (Orn), glutamic
        acid (Glu), and Glycine (Gly) were selected in the tissue. These dysregulated

        are one of the important indicators used in assessing the anthropic impact
        on aquatic ecosystems. The structure of macrophyte communities of two rivers
        were compared by species composition, dominant species and projective cover
        using statistical methods. It is shown that the influence of storm runoff
        on these rivers is manifested in the form of a change in the dominant species
        composition. Based on the statistical analysis carried out, it can be argued
        that, despite the peculiarities of the flora composition of each of the rivers,
        the influence of storm runoffs largely neutralizes this specificity, determining
        the situation in local areas immediately below the runoff. In the area of
        the effluent discharge the dominance of individual species and an increase
        in the area overgrown with macrophytes was observed. In the area of stormwater
        discharge on the Psel River, species were usually present: <jats:italic>Nuphar

        log-normal distribution is often used to analyze environmental data like daily
        rainfall amounts. The rainfall is of interest in Thailand because high variable
        climates can lead to periodic water stress and scarcity. The mean, standard
        deviation or coefficient of variation of the rainfall in the area is usually
        estimated. The climate moisture index is the ratio of plant water demand to
        precipitation. The climate moisture index should use the coefficient of variation
        instead of the standard deviation for comparison between areas with widely
        different means. The larger coefficient of variation indicates greater dispersion,
        whereas the lower coefficient of variation indicates the lower risk. The common
        coefficient of variation, is the weighted coefficients of variation based
        on <jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic> areas, presents the average daily rainfall.
        Therefore, the common coefficient of variation is used to describe overall
        water problems of <jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic> areas. In this paper, we propose
        four novel approaches for the confidence interval estimation of the common
        coefficient of variation of log-normal distributions based on the fiducial
        generalized confidence interval (FGCI), method of variance estimates recovery
        (MOVER), computational, and Bayesian approaches. A Monte Carlo simulation
        was used to evaluate the coverage probabilities and average lengths of the
        confidence intervals. In terms of coverage probability, the results show that
        the FGCI approach provided the best confidence interval estimates for most
        cases except for when the sample case was equal to six populations (<jats:italic>k<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a06)
        and the sample sizes were small (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>I<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sub>\u00a0&lt;\u00a050),
        for which the MOVER confidence interval estimates were the best. The efficacies
        of the proposed approaches are illustrated with example using real-life daily
        rainfall datasets from regions of Thailand.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10004","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,21]],"date-time":"2020-09-21T07:59:58Z","timestamp":1600675198000},"page":"e10004","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Confidence

        additives Sila-Max and Sila-Mix had no significant effect on the nutritional
        quality of the three silages regardless of when the samples were harvested.

        and multivariate logistic regression to identify <jats:italic>RPE65<\/jats:italic>-associated
        IRDs. A total of 21 Chinese probands with <jats:italic>RPE65<\/jats:italic>

        Fe<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup> (iron center), and active site cavity, while population
        variants were related to helix, loop, helices, and helix\u2013helix interactions.
        The novel prediction model showed accuracy and confidence in predicting the
        disease type of <jats:italic>RPE65<\/jats:italic> variants (AUC = 0.7531).
        The study identified 25 missense variants in Chinese patients, accounting
        for 72.4% of total mutations. A significant correlation was observed between

        disease variants, and requires continuous adjustment of public health measures.

        100% of the sequenced isolates), followed by N439K (98%) and P681R (76%).
        Several mutations were also identified in other genomes with a high frequency,

        a critical metabolic substrate, glutamine is not only involved in the progression
        of many cancers but is also related to angiogenesis. Glutamate dehydrogenase
        (GLDH), a key enzyme in glutamine metabolism, has been reported to regulate
        tumor proliferation; however, its relationship with microvascular invasion
        (MVI) is unclear. This study evaluated the ability of preoperative serum GLDH
        levels to predict MVI and the long-term survival of hepatocellular carcinoma
        (HCC) patients after liver transplantation (LT).<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>HCC

        factors shaping genetic structure of marine fish is challenging due to fewer
        barriers to gene flow in the ocean. However, genome-wide sequence data can
        greatly enhance our ability to delineate previously unidentified population
        structure as well as potential adaptive divergence. The small yellow croaker
        (<jats:italic>Larimichthys polyactis<\/jats:italic>) is a commercially important
        fish species with high gene flow and its overwintering populations experience
        heterogeneous environment, suggesting possible population differentiation
        and adaptive divergence. To delineate patterns of population structure as
        well as test for signatures of local adaptation, a total of 68,666 quality
        filtered SNP markers were identified for 80 individuals from four overwintering
        populations by using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq).
        Significant genetic differentiation among overwintering populations from the
        Central Yellow Sea, the South Yellow Sea and the North East China Sea were
        detected (Pair-wise<jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub>:
        0.00036\u20130.00390), which were consistent with population division of overwintering
        groups inferred from traditional ecological approaches. In addition, a total
        of 126 unique SNPs were detected to be significantly associated with environmental
        parameters (temperature, salinity and turbidity). These candidate SNPs were
        involved in multiple pathways such as energy metabolism and phagocytosis,
        suggesting they may play key roles in growth and innate immunity. Our results
        suggested the existence of hitherto unrecognized cryptic population structure
        and local adaptation in this high gene flow marine fish and thus gain new
        insights into the design of management strategies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.7242","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,3]],"date-time":"2019-07-03T07:18:50Z","timestamp":1562138330000},"page":"e7242","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["RAD
