      we still got time for sustainability and reasonable application of ideas of
      sustainable development? It has been just over twenty years since the Brundtland
      Commission Report but, taken as an axiological term; sustainable development
      resonates with older historical horizons. At the heart of a long running history
      we are beginning to articulate more or less sustaining relationships between
      man and nature. We have described the (human) needs in the environmental, economic
      and social dimension of sustainable development to show some amazing shift in
      perception of sustainable development from local to global level. We are convinced
      that historical lesson of sustainable development shows there is no more time
      for sustainability, but time for SOStainability. Our proposed S-O-S in SOStainability
      means Save Our Sustainability! SOStainability represents the need to end the
      compromise between economic development and natural life supporting systems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0015-2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"5-17","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Any

      aim of this paper is to describe the species biodiversity of important woody
      species in the riparian zone of wide floodplains in the Protected Landscape
      Area (PLA) Pood\u0159\u00ed (Central Europe, Czech Republic). The analysis of
      growth in terms of particular species was carried out to find out their growth
      potential. Another task was to evaluate the diversity and health condition of
      all trees and to determine the occurrence frequency of important woody species
      (IWS) in particular geobiocoene type groups of wide alluvial plains. The tree
      classification pyramid (veteran-representative-successor-expectant) was built
      up to provide the sufficient number of diverse IWS in the area. In total, 3,419
      IWS were mapped in the whole area of the PLA Pood\u0159\u00ed (81.5 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>).
      In wide alluvial plains, the <jats:italic>Ulmi-fraxineta carpini sup.<\/jats:italic>
      geobiocoene type group (GTG) shows the highest diversity. According to the surveys
      carried out in the area under investigation it is evident that there are a lot
      of IWS here deserving protection and the proposal of the appropriate management,
      which should be represented by the pyramid mentioned above. The pyramid would
      provide protection and care for the registered trees to reach a respectable
      age and maximum dimensions. It is necessary to preserve the species spectrum
      of the IWS to maintain the gene pool of initial populations and biodiversity
      in landscape. Some species exceed growth parameters of the same species at other
      floodplain sites in the Czech Republic and even in Europe.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0014-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:42Z","timestamp":1344590082000},"page":"57-75","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Important

      the Precautionary Principle in Designing and Managing Natura 2000 Areas (Exemplified
      by the Conservation of the Butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea Nausithous<\/jats:italic>
      in a Rural Landscape North of Dresden (Saxony))<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The
      precautionary principle is more and more incorporated into national law and
      decision-making on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
      In the coherent European network of protected areas Natura 2000, the precautionary
      principle finds expression in the obligation to provide favourable conditions
      for the long-term survival of species and habitats, especially of the priority
      ones listed in the annexes of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.
      After describing principles, structure, implementation and procedures of this
      rather new instrument for nature conservation using the example of one of the
      various Natura 2000 areas in Saxony (Germany), opportunities and problems for
      biodiversity conservation are outlined with particular regard for the situation
      in an agricultural landscape. Special attention is given to the following questions:
      requirements of and actual threats to the target species (the butterfly <jats:italic>Maculinea
      nausithous<\/jats:italic>), legal means and economic incentives for suitable
      measures, the management plan, and the role of stakeholders. It turns out that
      Natura 2000 could be an effective tool to advance nature conservation, and with
      special regard to the precautionary principle. Every effort is necessary to
      gain more public acceptance of Natura 2000, as well as to improve scientific
      knowledge concerning species and habitats under protection.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0002-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:33Z","timestamp":1344590013000},"page":"14-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Adopting

      is an important aspect in the evaluation of suitability of an area in the context
      of natural resource management or landscape ecology. In many geographic information
      software packages a distance function is included, but the creation of adequate
      accessibility models requires more than simple distance calculation and in practice
      is not that easy. A theoretical test area is used to demonstrate how different
      terrain variables will influence the results of the application of the distance
      function. With the understanding obtained that way, the approach is applied
      in a real case study area to illustrate its possibilities but also some difficulties
      and limitations that are still encountered.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0016-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"18-29","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Essibility

      Analysis of Factors Affecting Wind Damage in the \u0160umava National Park<\/jats:title><jats:p>This
      project forms part of the \"Remotely Accessed Decision Support System for Transnational
      Environmental Risk Management\" (STRiM) project undertaken within the framework
      of the European Union''s INTERREG IIIB CADSES programme. The test took place
      in a 70 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>test area within the western part of the \u0160umava
      National Park. It is commonly known that windthrow occurs frequently in the
      \u0160umava Mountains, and it tends to occur in particular areas. The intensity
      of windstorms and the amount of damage caused appear to be relatively constant.
      In the case of \u0160umava, such meteorological hazards frequently become biotic
      hazards as they are often followed by bark beetle infestations. We hypothesise
      that, in particular areas, the incidence of windthrow, the amount of harm done,
      and the cost of alleviating that damage are in close relationship with natural
      factors prevalent in the area and with previous human intervention (forestry)
      in the landscape. Analysis of such factors, and a comparison with actual data
      on windthrow, showed that a) the most damaged stands were generally found on
      gently sloping sites of 8-15 degrees; b) the leeward side of elevations were
      more heavily damaged; c) non-natural forest stands were subject to more damage;
      d) damage increased with increasing stand density; e) middle-aged stands of
      around 12 years were at greatest risk; and f) the most damaged portions of the
      test area were located at sites with normally drained and deep soils. Further,
      landscape relief and active surface character appeared to play an important
      role in modifying wind speed and direction, thereby increasing the wind''s devastating
      power.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0008-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:59Z","timestamp":1344590039000},"page":"52-66","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Geoinformation

      in a significant way. This paper presents the results of analysis of changes

      in the Vrapa\u010d National Nature Reserve, a model area used for research into
      optimal forest reserve management methods in the Czech Republic (Simon, 2007).
      Using GIS methods, it was determined that fragmentation within this floodplain
      forest area decreased slightly between 1938 and 2006, and that the ecological
      stability of the landscape remains high. The results speak in favour of those
      theories advocating anthropogenic conditioning of floodplain forest ecosystems
      and show that even strongly anthropogenically modified geobiocenoses may show
      a high level of ecological stability, which is especially characteristic of
      the geobiocenoses of floodplain forests (Mad\u011bra, 2003).<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0004-5","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:13:33Z","timestamp":1344590013000},"page":"39-48","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Changes

      a long-term development of the selected Slovak cultural landscape types (plains,
      basins, uplands, highlands, and mountains) in approx. 200 years, which shaped
      the main land use features as well as on the recent transformation trends. The
      land use development analyses showed that from a long term view perspective
      several distinct periods can be distinguished. Each of these periods was characteristic
      for certain land use changes depending both on the landscape character or the
      socioeconomic situation. The recent trends as land use intensification (intense
      agriculture, sub-urbanisation, industrial construction) or land use extensification
      (agricultural land overgrowing) are considered to be common for the entire Slovak
      territory. Special transformation trends reflect more local conditions, human
      needs and preferences (construction of water reservoirs, wind calamities or
      tourism resorts) and though they are spatially isolated and small they influence
      the majority of Slovak inhabitants.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.2478\/v10285-012-0018-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]],"date-time":"2012-08-10T09:14:38Z","timestamp":1344590078000},"page":"41-55","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Transformation

      the Western Scheldt Estuary near the Belgian-Dutch border, middle to late Eocene
      strata crop out at the current seafloor. Most vertebrae of large Eocene basilosaurid
      taxa from this area were previously described in several papers. They represent
      three morphotypes: elongated vertebrae of a large species of <jats:italic>Pachycetus<\/jats:italic>
      (Morphotype 1b), a not-elongated vertebra of a large \u2018dorudontid\u2019
      basilosaurid (Morphotype 2) and \u2018shortened\u2019 vertebrae of a new, unnamed
      taxon (Morphotype 3). This article deals with a still undescribed, smaller vertebra,
      NMR-16642, from this site. Our first aim was to date it by dinoflagellate cysts
      in adhering sediments. Yielding an age of about 38 Ma, it is one of the very
      few remains of basilosaurids from Europe, of which the age could be assessed
      with reasonable certainty. The vertebra, Morphotype 1a, is assigned to a small
      species of <jats:italic>Pachycetus<\/jats:italic>. High-quality CT scans are
      used to differentiate between NMR-16642, Morphotype 1a, and the large species
      of <jats:italic>Pachycetus,<\/jats:italic> Morphotype 1b. Another aim of this
      paper is to investigate the inner structure and vascularity of the study vertebra
      and that of the other morphotypes (1b, 2, 3) from this area by using high-quality
      CT scans. Notwithstanding differences in size, shape and compactness, the vertebral
      inner structure with a multi-layered cortex of periosteal bone, surrounding
      two cones of endosteal bone appears to be basically similar in all morphotypes.
      Apparently, this inner structure reflects the ontogenetic vertebral growth.
      An attempt to reconstruct the vascularity of the vertebrae reveals a remarkable
      pattern of interconnected vascular systems. From the dorsal and, if present,
      ventral foramina, vascular canals are running to a central vascular node. From
      this node a system of vascular canals goes to the epiphyseal ends, giving rise
      to separate systems for cortex and cones. It is the first time that the vascularity
      of vertebrae of archaeocetes is investigated.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.16541","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,25]],"date-time":"2024-01-25T08:35:56Z","timestamp":1706171756000},"page":"e16541","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["A

      to its remote and isolated location, Antarctica is home to a unique diversity
      of species. The harsh conditions have shaped a primarily highly adapted endemic
      fauna. This includes the notothenioid family Channichthyidae. Their exceptional
      physiological adaptations have made this family of icefish the focus of many
      studies. However, studies on their ecology, especially on their parasite fauna,
      are comparatively rare. Parasites, directly linked to the food chain, can function
      as biological indicators and provide valuable information on host ecology (e.g.,
      trophic interactions) even in remote habitats with limited accessibility, such
      as the Southern Ocean. In the present study, channichthyid fish (<jats:italic>Champsocephalus

      off South Shetland Island, Elephant Island, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula
      (CCAML statistical subarea 48.1). The parasite fauna consisted of 14 genera
      and 15 species, belonging to the six taxonomic groups including Digenea (four
      species), Nematoda (four), Cestoda (two), Acanthocephala (one), Hirudinea (three),
      and Copepoda (one). The stomach contents were less diverse with only Crustacea

      analysis, and 5255 genes highly associated with these four immune cells were
      identified by WGCNA. These immune genes were found to be significantly enriched
      in the TNF signalling pathway by enrichment analysis. Finally, PPI analysis
      was performed on genes enriched in this pathway and three key genes (CXCL1,

      with CAP, the numbers of bacteria, virus, chlamydia, and mycoplasma infection
      were 1,188, 975, 321, and 1, respectively. Co-existing species showed high prevalence
      in CAP, and the prevalence of children infected with only one pathogen was 20.31%.
      The numbers of children infected with two and three pathogens were the highest,
      accounting for 29.22% and 25.17%, respectively. Among the 44 pathogens detected
      using tNGS, 17 species of bacteria, 25 species of viruses, one species of chlamydia,

      was observed to be high. The pathogens involved in CAP were closely related
      to the age of the child. In addition, tNGS was shown to better identify pathogens
      than the standard detection method, which is crucial for improving the accuracy
      of early CAP diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment in a timely manner,
      ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.18810","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,8]],"date-time":"2025-01-08T08:58:37Z","timestamp":1736326717000},"page":"e18810","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Clinical

      disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a significant disease pandemic. Dhaka City
      alone has contributed about one-third to the total COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh.
      Globally, patients with infectious diseases, including COVID-19, experience
      stigma. There was no quantitative estimate of stigma experienced by patients
      with COVID-19 in the country. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence
      of stigma and its associated factors among patients with COVID-19 in Dhaka.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>A
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 respondents aged 18 years or older
      who had been hospitalized or had stayed at home and were tested negative 15
      days to 6 months before the day of data collection. Data collection was done
      through in-person and telephone interviews using a semi-structured survey questionnaire.
      A 15-item COVID-19-related stigma scale questionnaire was used to assess stigma.
      Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors
      of stigma.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>More
      than half (53.1%) of the respondents experienced stigma when they were COVID-19
      positive. Females were at a 3.24 times higher risk of experiencing stigma than
      their male counterparts. Respondents from the 60+ age group and 40\u201359 age
      group were 63.0% and 48.0% less likely to experience stigma than those from
      the 18\u201339 age group. Non-hospitalised patients had 1.67 times higher odds

      study reported a high prevalence of stigma among the patients with COVID-19
      in Dhaka City. The current evidence base of stigma experience among patients
      with COVID-19 offers a solid foundation for creating effective strategies and
      policies and designing appropriate interventions to counter stigma, which will
      improve the psychological well-being of patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14092","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T11:25:47Z","timestamp":1665055547000},"page":"e14092","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Stigma

      and both functions are influenced by human habits. In a previous preliminary

      Cratera<\/jats:italic> is a genus of land planarians endemic to the Brazilian
      Atlantic forest. The species of this genus are distinguished from each other
      by a series of external and internal characters, nonetheless they represent
      a challenging taxonomic issue due to the extreme alikeness of the species analysed
      in the present work. To resolve these difficulties, we have performed morphological
      analyses and used three nuclear markers (ribosomal 18S and 28S, Elongation Factor,
      a new anonymous marker named Tnuc813) and two mitochondrial fragments (Cytochrome
      c oxidase subunit I gene, and a fragment encompasing NADH deshydrogenase subunit
      4 gene, trnF and the beginning of the Cytochrome c oxidase I gene) in an integrative
      taxonomic study.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>To
      unveil cryptic species, we applied a molecular species delimitation approach
      based on molecular discovery methods, followed by a validation method. The putative
      species so delimited were then validated on the basis of diagnostic morphological
      features.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We
      discovered and described four new species, namely <jats:italic>Cratera assu,
      C. tui, C. boja,<\/jats:italic> and<jats:italic> C. imbiri<\/jats:italic>. A
      fifth new species, <jats:italic>C. paraitinga<\/jats:italic> was not highly
      supported by molecular evidence, but was described because its morphological
      attributes are unique. Our study documents for the genus <jats:italic>Cratera<\/jats:italic>
      the presence of a number of highly similar species, a situation that is present

      ST-T segment changes are prevalent and are proven risk factors for early onset
      of cardiovascular diseases. They can increase all-cause mortality by 100\u223c200%
      and are candidate for early signs of cardiovascular changes. Nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent worldwide and is one facet of a multisystem
      disease that confers substantial increases morbidity and mortality of nonalcoholic
      fatty liver-related cardiovascular diseases. It is unclear whether NAFLD is
      associated with non-specific ST-T changes warning early signs of cardiovascular
      changes. Therefore, we investigated this association.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A
      cross-sectional study was designed that included a sample consisting of 32,922
      participants who underwent health examinations. Participants with missing information,
      excessive alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, chronic liver disease or established
      cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Electrocardiograms were used for analysis
      of non-specific ST-T segment changes. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonographic
      detection of hepatic steatosis without other liver diseases. A multivariable
      logistic regression model was served to calculate the OR and 95% CI for non-specific
      ST-T segment changes.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The
      prevalence of non-specific ST-T segment changes was 6.5% in participants with
      NAFLD, however, the prevalence of NAFLD was 42.9% in participants with non-specific
      ST-T segment changes. NAFLD was independently associated with non-specific ST-T
      segment changes (OR: 1.925, 95% CI: 1.727-2.143, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001).
      After adjusting for age, sex, heart rate, hypertension, body mass index, fasting

      thyroid disease (AITD), which is characterized by an increased presence of thyroid
      autoantibodies (TAbs), such as antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs)
      and antibodies against thyroglobulin (TgAbs), has been reported to be associated
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because AITD and RA both involve autoimmunity.
      However, few data are available on the incidence of TAbs in Chinese RA patients,
      and studies on the association between TAbs and joint damage as well as synovitis
      in RA patients remain sparse. Here, we aimed to evaluate the incidence of TAbs
      in a consecutive Chinese RA cohort and to investigate whether the elevated presence
      of TAbs is associated with joint damage and synovitis in RA patients.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>A
      total of 125 hospitalized RA patients were consecutively recruited. Clinical
      data and available synovial tissues were collected at baseline, and TAbs and
      thyroid function were detected by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Patients who
      tested positive for TPOAbs or TgAbs were classified as the TAbs-positive group,
      and patients who tested positive for neither TPOAbs nor TgAbs were recruited
      as the TAbs-negative group. Disease activity was assessed using DAS28-ESR (the
      disease activity score in 28 joints and including the erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate). X-ray assessment of the hand\/wrist was performed according to the Sharp\/van
      der Heijde-modified Sharp score (mTSS), and patients with an mTSS score &gt;10
      were defined as having radiographic joint damage (RJD). Serial tissue sections
      were stained immunohistochemically for CD3, CD15, CD20, CD34, CD38, and CD68,
      and synovitis were assessed according to Krenn\u2019s synovitis score.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>A
      total of 44 (35%) patients were positive for either TPOAbs or TgAbs. Importantly,
      there was a significantly greater percentage of patients with RJD in the TAbs-positive
      group versus the TAbs-negative group (68% vs. 42%,<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.005).
      Compared with the TAbs-negative group, significantly more CD38-positive plasma
      cells infiltrated the TAbs-positive synovium, and a higher percentage of patients
      with high-grade synovitis were observed in the TAbs-positive group (5\/8, 63%
      vs. 5\/14, 36%). Moreover, RF positivity and disease activity indicators, including
      TJC28, DAS28-ESR, and CDAI, were significantly higher in the TAbs-positive group
      (all<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). Adjusted logistic regression
      analysis revealed that positive TAbs (OR 2.999, 95% CI [1.301\u20136.913];<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.010)

      were independently associated with RJD, and an odds ratio of 2.845 (95% CI [1.062\u20137.622])
      was found for RJD in women with positive TAbs (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a037)

      delimitation of cryptic species is a challenge for biodiversity conservation.
      Anurans show high cryptic diversity levels, and molecular species delimitation
      methods could help identify putative new species. Additionally, species delimitation
      approaches can provide important results for cryptic species conservation, with
      integrative methods adding robustness to results. <jats:italic>Ischnocnema manezinho<\/jats:italic>
      was described from Santa Catarina Island (SCI), southern Brazil. More recently,
      some inventories indicated continental populations supposedly similar in morphology
      to it. If these records are confirmed as <jats:italic>I. manezinho,<\/jats:italic>
      it would likely change its endangered status on National Red List, removing
      the species from conservation agendas. We investigated the threatened frog <jats:italic>Ischnocnema
      manezinho<\/jats:italic>, to evaluate if the continental populations belong
      to this species or if they form an undescribed species complex.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We

      independence between <jats:italic>I. manezinho<\/jats:italic> from SCI, Arvoredo
      Island, and continental populations.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p><jats:italic>Ischnocnema

      remaining lineages should be further investigated through a taxonomic review.
      Our results point to a small geographic range of <jats:italic>Ischnocnema manezinho<\/jats:italic>.
      Additionally, the species occurs in isolated fragments of forest in SCI surrounded
      by expanding urban areas, confirming its status as Endangered. Thus, the protection
      and monitoring of <jats:italic>I. manezinho<\/jats:italic> and the taxonomic
      description of the continental and Arvoredo Island candidate species should

      T (Treg) cells are important immune cells that are regulated by adaptive immunity
      in the composition of Treg-cell subsets and T-cell receptors (TCRs). Treg cells
      are related to most autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), RA is typically attributed to kidney
      deficiency (KD) associated with the immunosenescence that causes immune dysfunction
      and the impaired function of Treg cells. So far, however, no mechanism related
      to KD and immune repertoires has been identified in RA.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Flow
      cytometry and high-throughput Treg-cell receptor sequencing were used to investigate
      the amount of different Treg-cell subsets and the diversity of TCRs between
      RA patients and healthy subjects, as well as between KD RA and non-KD RA patients.
      RT-qPCR was used to validate the high-throughput sequencing results.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The
      data showed that the amount of na\u00efve Treg cells in KD patients was less
      than in non-KD RA patients (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> = 0.004) with no significant
      differences observed between other subsets. In the TCR of Treg cells, the length
      of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) was low and clonotypes increased
      in the KD group compared with the non-KD group. The diversity and abundance
      of Treg TCRs were low, as determined by the Hill number. In addition, several
      V(D)J combinations, such as T-cell receptor beta variable 7-2 (TRBV7-2), TRBV11-1,
      TRBV13, TRBV15, and TRBJ2-3, varied significantly between the two groups, indicating
      that KD causes Treg dysfunction. RT-qPCR shows that FOXP3 expression in peripheral
      blood Treg is lower in KD than in non-KD.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The

      the regulatory network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) as hallmarks for
      breast cancer development has great significance and could provide therapeutic

      dataset and identified potential mRNAs that were associated with BRCA mutation
      patients within this ceRNA network. A total of 11 prognostic mRNAs and a risk
      model were identified and developed by univariate Cox regression analysis and
      the LASSO regression analysis as well as stepAIC method. Genomic landscape was
      treated by mutect2 and fisher. Immune characteristics was analyzed by ESTIMATE,
      MCP-counter. TIDE analysis was conducted to predict immunotherapy. The clinical
      treatment outcomes of BRCA mutation patients were assessed using a nomogram.
      The proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines were examined
      using CCK8 assay and transwell assay.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title>Result<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We

      dismal prognosis, low response to immunotherapy, less immune cell infiltration
      and tumor mutation burden (TMB). High-risk patients were sensitive to six anti-tumor
      drugs, while low-risk patient were sensitive to 47 drugs. The risk score was
      the most effective on evaluating patients\u2019 survival. The robustness and
      good prediction performance were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

      acids (HAs) are complex organic substances with abundant functional groups (<jats:italic>e.g.<\/jats:italic>,
      carboxyl, phenolic-OH, <jats:italic>etc<\/jats:italic>.). They are commonly
      distributed in the soil environment and exert a double-edged sword effect in
      controlling the migration and transformation of uranium. However, the effects
      of HAs on dynamic processes associated with uranium transformation are still
      unclear. In this study, we used HAs derived from leonardite (L-HA) and commercial
      HA (C-HA) as exogenous organic matter and C-HA as the reference. UO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>,
      UO<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>, and UO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>(NO<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>)<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>
      were used as the sources of U to explore the fractionations of uranium in the
      soil. We also studied the behavior of the HA. The incubation experiments were
      designed to investigate the effects of HA on the soil pH, uranium fraction transformation,
      dynamic behavior of exchangeable, weak acid, and labile uranium. The observations
      were made for one month. The results showed that soil pH decreased for L-HA
      but increased for C-HA. Under these conditions, uranium tended to transform
      into an inactive fraction. The dynamic behavior of exchangeable, weak acid,
      and labile uranium varied with the sources of HA and uranium. This study highlighted
      that HA could affect soil pH and the dynamic redistribution of U fractions.
      The results suggest that the sources of HA and U should be considered when using
      HA as the remediation material for uranium-contaminated soils.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.14162","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,7]],"date-time":"2022-10-07T07:14:57Z","timestamp":1665126897000},"page":"e14162","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effect

      is a large group of ray-finned fishes which underwent a rapid radiation in the
      Middle Triassic. Until recently, 11 stem neopterygians have been recovered from
      the early Middle Triassic Luoping Biota in eastern Yunnan, China, and they are
      small to medium-sized fishes. Here, I report the discovery of a new stem neopterygian,
      <jats:italic>Feroxichthys<\/jats:italic> y<jats:italic>unnanensis<\/jats:italic>
      gen. et sp. nov. from the Luoping Biota, which represents the first evidence
      of large-sized stem neopteygians in this biota with a total length of ~340 mm
      (290 mm in standard length). The skull of the new taxon is exceptionally well-preserved,
      showing some peculiar features rarely known in other stem neopterygians, for
      example fusion of paired premaxillae, fusion of lacrimal with maxilla, and a
      fused parieto-dermopterotic with a strong posterior process. Phylogenetic studies
      recover <jats:italic>Feroxichthys<\/jats:italic> as a basal colobodontid, and
      a revised diagnosis of this family is presented. The feeding apparatus indicates
      that <jats:italic>Feroxichthys<\/jats:italic> might have been predominantly
      durophagous, resembling other colobodontids. However, the anterior peg-like
      teeth in the jaws of <jats:italic>Feroxichthys<\/jats:italic> are much longer
      and stronger than other colobodontids, enabling a more powerful initial prey
      capture before food was passed posteriorly to molariform teeth for crushing
      in the oral cavity. As a mysterious large durophagous predator previously unknown
      from the Luoping Biota, the new finding is important not only for understanding
      the early diversification of neopterygians during this age but also for investigating
      the trophic structure in this marine ecosystem.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.10229","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,20]],"date-time":"2020-10-20T08:22:35Z","timestamp":1603182155000},"page":"e10229","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["<i>Feroxichthys

      mechanisms underlying RNA splicing regulation in response to viral infection
      are poorly understood. Classical swine fever (CSF), one of the most economically
      important and highly contagious swine diseases worldwide, is caused by classical
      swine fever virus (CSFV). Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain
      the digital gene expression (DGE) profile in swine umbilical vein endothelial
      cells (SUVEC) to identify different response genes for CSFV by using both Shimen
      and C strains. The numbers of clean tags obtained from the libraries of the
      control and both CSFV-infected libraries were 3,473,370, 3,498,355, and 3,327,493
      respectively. In the comparison among the control, CSFV-C, and CSFV-Shimen groups,
      644, 158, and 677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed in the
      three groups. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that many of these DEGs were
      enriched in spliceosome, ribosome, proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,
      cell cycle, focal adhesion, Wnt signalling pathway, etc., where the processes
      differ between CSFV strains of differing virulence. To further elucidate important
      mechanisms related to the differential infection by the CSFV Shimen and C strains,
      we identified four possible profiles to assess the significantly expressed genes
      only by CSFV Shimen or CSFV C strain. GO analysis showed that infection with
      CSFV Shimen and C strains disturbed \u2018RNA splicing\u2019 of SUVEC, resulting
      in differential \u2018gene expression\u2019 in SUVEC. Mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) was identified as a significant response regulator contributed to impact
      on SUVEC function for CSFV Shimen. This computational study suggests that CSFV
      of differing virulence could induce alterations in RNA splicing regulation in
      the host cell to change cell metabolism, resulting in acute haemorrhage and
      pathological damage or infectious tolerance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.2113","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,8]],"date-time":"2016-06-08T06:26:39Z","timestamp":1465367199000},"page":"e2113","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Different

      (Bravecto\u2122) is a novel isoxazoline ectoparasiticide used for controlling
      ectoparasites of domestic mammals and is increasingly being used on wildlife.
      The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics,
      and safety of fluralaner on mammals given its increasing use. The search was
      performed in GoogleScholar and the SciFinder databases using the terms \u2018fluralaner\u2019
      and \u2018Bravecto\u2122\u2019, and was concluded on 30th August, 2024. A total
      of 250 references were initially saved and reduced to 121 peer-reviewed journal
      articles using PRISMA guidelines, based on the removal of duplicates, those
      published in low quality journals (ranked less than Q2), and limiting publications
      to clinical trials. Articles were then categorised and ranked using the level
      of evidence, Cochrane \u2018risk of bias\u2019 assessment tool, methodological
      quality, and study size. Overall, the efficacy of fluralaner has been assessed
      on 14 mammalian species, and pharmacokinetic investigations conducted on 15.
      Fluralaner was mostly effective at treating some ectoparasites on captive individuals
      when there was little chance of re-infection; however, it did not prevent bites
      from blood-sucking ectoparasites and could not prevent blood-borne pathogen
      transfer to host animals. Very few studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics
      of fluralaner, and hence were difficult to compare; however, wombats differed
      greatly from their eutherian counterparts in their C<jats:sub>max<\/jats:sub>
      and t\u00bd values and require further investigation. Overall, fluralaner was
      deemed moderately safe; however, most studies were classified as fair in terms
      of quality and most studies were based on small or very small sample numbers.
      Nineteen studies reported side effects, one of which included signs of severe
      neurological toxicity, with most of the articles not reporting on safety either
      positively or negatively. Concerns were raised regarding the extended time fluralaner
      was detected in faeces and subsequently environmental contamination is a concern.
      No longer-term impacts of the use of fluralaner have been investigated, and
      wider implications of the use of this ectoparasiticide have not yet been assessed.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.18882","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,12]],"date-time":"2025-03-12T08:05:11Z","timestamp":1741766711000},"page":"e18882","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

      sonography (TCS) has emerged as a potential diagnostic tool for Parkinson\u2019s

      depression among these patients. We sought to reproduce these findings in an
      ongoing larger study of patients with parkinsonian syndromes.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods.<\/jats:bold>A
