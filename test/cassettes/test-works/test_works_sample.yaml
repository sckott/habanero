        genetic condition, is a genetic disorder that affects many people. Williams
        syndrome is a hereditary disorder that can affect anyone at birth. It marks
        medical and cognitive issues, such as cardiovascular illness, developmental
        delays, and learning impairments. This is accompanied by exceptional verbal
        abilities, a gregarious attitude, and a passion for music. Down syndrome and
        William Syndrome are both genetic illnesses. However, it can be distinguished
        from the arrangement of chromosome 21. Down syndrome and William syndrome
        can also be identified by recognizing faces, or facial characteristics, such
        as observing particular facial features. Therefore, this research develops
        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to recognize Down syndrome
        and William syndrome using a facial recognition approach. A total of 480 facial
        photos were used in the study, with 390 images used for training data and
        90 images used for testing data. The identification class is divided into
        three categories, Down syndrome, William syndrome, and normal. There are 160
        photos in each patient class. This research presents two CNN architectures
        using a grayscale image of 256\u00d7256 pixels. The first CNN architecture
        comprises 12 layers, while the second comprises 15 layers. The average accuracy
        results with 12 layers were 91% by attempting to train and test six times.
        With 15 layers, the average accuracy value is 89%. In comparison, the first
        architecture has the highest accuracy value.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.17977\/um018v4i22021p138-144","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,15]],"date-time":"2022-03-15T06:43:17Z","timestamp":1647326597000},"page":"138","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["CNN
