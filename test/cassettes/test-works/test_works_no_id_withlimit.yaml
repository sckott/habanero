        3507 <\/jats:p><jats:p> Purpose: To detect IGF-1R on circulating tumor cells
        (CTCs) as a biomarker in the clinical development of a monoclonal human antibody,
        CP-751,871, targeting IGF-1R. Experimental Design: An automated sample preparation
        and analysis system for enumerating CTCs (Celltracks) was adapted for detecting
        IGF-1R positive CTCs with a diagnostic antibody targeting a different IGF-1R
        epitope to CP-751,871. This assay was utilized in three phase I trials of
        CP-751,871 as a single agent or with chemotherapy and was validated using
        cell lines and blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic
        carcinoma. Results: There was no interference between the analytical and therapeutic
        antibodies. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent, and in combination
        with docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel, at doses ranging from 0.05 mg\/kg
        to 20 mg\/kg. Eighty patients were enrolled on phase 1 studies of CP-751,871,
        with 47 (59%) patients having CTCs detected during the study. Prior to treatment
        26 patients (33%) had CTCs, with 23 having detectable IGF-1R positive CTCs.
        CP-751,871 alone, and CP-751,871 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, decreased CTCs
        and IGF-1R positive CTCs; these increased towards the end of the 21-day cycle
        in some patients, falling again with retreatment. CTCs were commonest in advanced
        hormone refractory prostate cancer (11\/20). Detectable IGF-1R expression
        on CTCs before treatment with CP-751,871 and docetaxel was associated with
        a higher frequency of PSA decline by more than 50% (6\/10 vs 2\/8 patients).
        A relationship was observed between sustained falls in CTCs counts and PSA
        declines by more than 50%. Conclusions: IGF-1R expression is detectable by
        immunofluorescence on CTCs. These data support the further evaluation of CTCs
        in pharmacodynamic studies and patient selection, particularly in advanced
        prostate cancer. <\/jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships
