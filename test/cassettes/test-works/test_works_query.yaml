        is perhaps the most important, but least formally discussed, aspect of current
        ecological research and teaching. The last twenty years has demonstrated that
        this is no longer a viable approach and the rise of climate change research,
        and its concomitant denial, has brought disagreement and outright refusal
        to accept facts to the research community and the wider world. This has, in
        turn, produced a vigorous research community aimed specifically at challenging
        false ideas and getting accurate science fully embedded into the public sphere.
        What is less common is an exploration of the parameters surrounding communication
        and the outputs of discourse. Ecology suffers from exactly the same problems
        as climate science but without the mass of research exploring the issues and
        potential solutions. The aim of this article is to propose a model of communication
        and outline the key factors involved as well as point toward some solutions.
        As far as can be ascertained, there is no model of ecological communication
        extant. Some research has put forward some elements but it is far from comprehensive.
        It became obvious that using a systems model would provide the base needed.
        Research starts with gathering data (input), working on that data (processing),
        and producing an end product that people can see\/use (output). At this stage,
        the model can be left as it is because it follows the usual route of current
        research (as exemplified by academia, for example). However, it was proposed,
        early on, to broaden this remit. The original goal was to explore how information
        can be distorted between production and (often multiple chains of) users and
        how such distortion might be ameliorated. This started in climate science
        but has recently moved to ecology. Thus, the final iteration of the proposed
        model consists of four parts. The first is the creation of a product\u2014usually
        research project and associated data. This aspect is subject to a range of
        political and logistical biases thus ensuring that the aim of studying all
        aspects of ecology is unlikely to be achieved. From here, data go into the
        process of being prepared for publication. Again, a series of forces control
        and constrain what is able to be later communicated. This ranges from philosophical
        and ideological limitations through to political and sociological filters.
        Cognition plays a key part not only in interpreting data but also introducing
        bias (deliberate or otherwise) into the results. From there, the move is to
        publish. Consumers take material from a range of media who may, or may not,
        have allowed publication. It is also the place where research output gets
        a wider airing and where further misinterpretation can be found. Normally,
        this would feed back into initial product stage but here the aim is to create
        a fourth division, a precursor, that argues that by studying issues in ecological
        communication, adaptations can be made to make it more effective and less
        prone to mis\/disinformation. The aim here is to provide a practical element
        to assist improvement of ecological communication.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0238","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,25]],"date-time":"2022-07-25T14:38:07Z","timestamp":1658759887000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Communicating

        ecology is a branch of study and thinking within the ecological sciences that
        focuses on the ecosystem\u2014a dynamic network of interactions of organisms
        and their environment\u2014and the importance of these interactions to the
        organisms and earth system processes. The discipline represents one of two
        different epistemological approaches within ecology that emerged in the 20th
        century: a species-centric community-based approach, and a process-centric
        ecosystem-based approach. Both approaches study the ways in which species
        interact among themselves and their environment, share a common language,
        and share a common set of principles. The community-based approach focuses
        on how species\u2019 distributions and abundances are shaped by their resource
        needs and tolerances to environmental conditions, and by their interactions
        with other species. The ecosystem-based approach represents a significant
        departure in that it considers both the resource needs and tolerances of species
        and their interactions with other species, but also factors in the contributions
        that species make to earth system processes (e.g., biogeochemical cycles,
        climate). The two perspectives are not as mutually exclusive as the phrasing
        of the approaches suggests, but rather offer different approaches to how we
        view the environment and communities and the factors that regulate them. In
        the 21st century, modern ecosystem science includes the influences that humans
        have as part of ecological communities and as drivers of change in ecological
        communities. This linkage within the ecosystem perspective of biology affecting
        the physical environment, and the recent developments that include the social
        and human dimensions, has positioned the approach as a critical one in understanding
        the relationship among global processes and the services that ecosystems provide
        to human well-being that is embodied in the emerging science of sustainability.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0202","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,28]],"date-time":"2018-08-28T09:14:08Z","timestamp":1535447648000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecosystem
