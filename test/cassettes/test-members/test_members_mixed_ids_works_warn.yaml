        lipomas that occur in the trunk and proximal extremities are commonly dissected

        the epiglottis has been absent. Microscopic laryngeal surgery is appropriate
        to extirpate small epiglottic lipomas. However, microscopic laryngeal surgery
        may be insufficient for giant epiglottic lipomas because there is restricted
        visualization of the operating field of the tumor under the microscope. Furthermore,
        microscopic surgical instruments are very small to manipulate giant lipomas,

        spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) can be accomplished with either

        undergoing Warshaw surgery. The medical records and follow-up data of patients
        who underwent LSPDP in Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, were reviewed retrospectively.
        A total of thirty-five patients were involved in this study, including 17
        cases of patients who were treated with Warshaw procedure (WT) while the other
        18 cases had splenic vessels preserved (SVP). Compared with the SVP group,
        the operative time and intraoperative blood loss in WT group were improved
        significantly. The incidence of early postoperative splenic infarction was
        higher in WT group. However, there was no report of splenic abscess or second
        operation. Follow-up data confirmed that there was no significant difference
        in spleen phagocytosis and immune function compared with normal healthy population.
        Our study confirms that LSPDP-Warshaw procedure is a safe and efficient treatment
        for the benign or low grade malignant tumors in distal pancreas in selected
        patients. The long-term spleen function is normal after Warshaw procedure.
        Preoperative assessment and intraoperative exploration are recommended for

        Lung cancer continues to be a burden worldwide with an estimated 2.09 million
        new cases of lung cancer and 1.76 million deaths in 2018. MicroRNAs (miRs)
        are key regulators of gene expression and show their oncogenic or antioncogenic
        role in human cancers including lung cancer. In this study, we test the hypothesis
        that miR-34c-5p functions as a candidate antioncomiR in lung adenocarcinoma
        by targeting NUF2. Methods. The expression pattern of miR-34c-5p and NUF2
        was evaluated in 202 biopsy specimens from patients with lung adenocarcinoma
        and 176 biopsy specimens from patients with benign lung diseases. Interaction
        between miR-34c-5p and NUF2 was verified by the luciferase-based assay. Cell
        viability and invasion assays were carried out in cultured A549 cells treated
        with miR-34c-5p mimic, inhibitor, and siRNA against NUF2. Results. NUF2 was
        highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma samples and related to the differentiation
        degree, TNM stage, and presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Patients with
        NUF2 overexpression had reduced overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
        (DFS) compared to patients with underexpression. Cox multivariate analysis
        revealed that high expression of NUF2, advanced TNM stage, well\/moderate
        differentiation, and existence of LNM were unfavorable prognostic factors.
        siRNA-mediated knockdown of NUF2 inhibits A549 cell viability and invasion.
        miR-34c-5p was expressed at a poor level in lung adenocarcinoma samples and
        related to the differentiation degree, TNM stage, and presence of LNM. miR-34c-5p
        underexpression contributes to reduced OS and DFS, which was demonstrated
        as an unfavorable prognostic factor by Cox multivariate analysis. siRNA-mediated
        knockdown of NUF2 could ablate miR-34c-5p inhibition-mediated effects on A549
        cells. Conclusion. Our results prove the hypothesis that miR-34c-5p could
        suppress lung adenocarcinoma progression by binding to the NUF2 gene. The
        study is a significant step towards extending our understanding of the mode
        of miRNA regulation in lung adenocarcinoma.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9152985","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]],"date-time":"2021-06-21T21:35:28Z","timestamp":1624311328000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["MicroRNA-34c-5p

        explore the performance of hybrid sail and overcome the congestion of geostationary
        orbit, this work proposes a method intended to optimize the trajectories of
        the spacecraft formation and extend the concept of displaced geostationary
        orbit by loosening the relative distance and introducing a station-keeping
        box. The multispacecraft formation is a typical complex system with nonlinear
        dynamics, and the hybrid propulsion system introduces additional complexity.
        To solve this problem, suboptimal trajectories with constant relative distance
        constraints are first found with inverse methods, which were referred to as
        ideal displaced geostationary orbits. Then, the suboptimal trajectories are
        used as a first guess for a direct optimization algorithm based on Gauss pseudospectral
        algorithm, which loosens the relative distance constraints and allows the
        spacecraft to be placed anywhere inside the station-keeping box. The optimization
        results show that the loosely formation and station-keeping box can create
        more flexible trajectories and achieve higher efficiency of the hybrid sail
        propulsion system, which can save about 40% propellant consumption.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/3576187","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,6]],"date-time":"2018-06-06T23:31:01Z","timestamp":1528327861000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Loosely

        provides the information for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM ).
        K-means clustering method is implemented to extract data from different objects.
        In addition, the robot avoids the obstacles by the avoidance function. The
        closed-loop controller reduces the error between the real position and estimated

        into alternate convergence and divergence of the guided beam. Second-order
