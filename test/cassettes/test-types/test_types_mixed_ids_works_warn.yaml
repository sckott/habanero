        3507 <\/jats:p><jats:p> Purpose: To detect IGF-1R on circulating tumor cells
        (CTCs) as a biomarker in the clinical development of a monoclonal human antibody,
        CP-751,871, targeting IGF-1R. Experimental Design: An automated sample preparation
        and analysis system for enumerating CTCs (Celltracks) was adapted for detecting
        IGF-1R positive CTCs with a diagnostic antibody targeting a different IGF-1R
        epitope to CP-751,871. This assay was utilized in three phase I trials of
        CP-751,871 as a single agent or with chemotherapy and was validated using
        cell lines and blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic
        carcinoma. Results: There was no interference between the analytical and therapeutic
        antibodies. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent, and in combination
        with docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel, at doses ranging from 0.05 mg\/kg
        to 20 mg\/kg. Eighty patients were enrolled on phase 1 studies of CP-751,871,
        with 47 (59%) patients having CTCs detected during the study. Prior to treatment
        26 patients (33%) had CTCs, with 23 having detectable IGF-1R positive CTCs.
        CP-751,871 alone, and CP-751,871 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, decreased CTCs
        and IGF-1R positive CTCs; these increased towards the end of the 21-day cycle
        in some patients, falling again with retreatment. CTCs were commonest in advanced
        hormone refractory prostate cancer (11\/20). Detectable IGF-1R expression
        on CTCs before treatment with CP-751,871 and docetaxel was associated with
        a higher frequency of PSA decline by more than 50% (6\/10 vs 2\/8 patients).
        A relationship was observed between sustained falls in CTCs counts and PSA
        declines by more than 50%. Conclusions: IGF-1R expression is detectable by
        immunofluorescence on CTCs. These data support the further evaluation of CTCs
        in pharmacodynamic studies and patient selection, particularly in advanced
        prostate cancer. <\/jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships

        detection systems. The potassium chloride thermionic and electron capture
        detectors were arranged: (1) in parallel; (2) in series with a stream splitter
        between the detectors; and (3) in series. Systems 1 and 2 use the same type
        of thermionic detector, whereas a modification of this detector is used for
        System 3. Collaborative results show these systems to be equivalent for the
        quantitative measurement of multiple organophosphorus pesticides at 0.5 and
        2.0 ppm. The pesticides studied were ronnel, ethion, Diazinon, malathion,
        methyl parathion, parathion, and carbophenothion. Operational and performance
        characteristics of dual detection and of thermionic gas chromatography are
        also discussed. It is recommended that all three systems studied be listed
        as official, first action for analysis of multiple pesticide residues<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/jaoac\/51.3.666","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,24]],"date-time":"2020-02-24T08:09:14Z","timestamp":1582531754000},"page":"666-675","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Collaborative

        Action CA 18213: Rural NEET Youth Network: Modeling the risks underlying rural
        NEETs social exclusion","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>This
        report outlines in detail the situation of rural Youths Neither in Employment,
        nor in Education or Training (NEET) aged between 15 and 34 years old, over
        the last decade (2009-2019) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To do this, the report
        utilised indicators of: you-th population; youth employment and unemployment;
        education; and, NEETs distribution. The characterisation of all indicators
        adopted the degree of urbanisation as a central cri-terion, enabling proportional
        comparisons between rural areas, towns and suburbs, cities and the whole country.
        These analyses are further divided into age subgroups and, where possible,
        into sex groups for greater detail. The statistical procedures adopted across
        the different selected dimensions involve: des-criptive longitudinal analysis;
        using graphical displays (e.g., overlay line charts); and, the calculation
        of proportional absolute and relative changes between 2009 and 2013, 2013
        and 2019, and finally 2009 and 2019. These time ranges were chosen to capture
        the in-dicators evolution before and after the economic crisis which hit European
        countries. All data was extracted from ILOSTAT explorer public datasets.The
        analyses show that between 2009 and 2019 youth population in both rural and
        urban areas decreased. In general, a strong decline in youth population was
        observed within all categories, with the most significant decrease within
        the age group 25-29 (21.57%) and 15-19 (20.35%). Youth employment has tended
        to decrease overall, and the decrease is stron-ger within rural regions. Interestingly,
        youth unemployment has also tended to decrease, and a significantly higher
        share of unemployed youth is from rural regions. A somewhat similar trend
        is observed in the field of education where the number of those enrolled significantly
        decreased during the observed period for all education levels in Bosnia and
        Herzegovina. The ESLET rate tended to decrease, while the proportion of the
        female po-pulation tends to have higher ESLET levels compared to the male
        population. However, the ESLET rate is still below the 10% target defined
        by the Europe 2020 strategy. Finally, the proportion of NEETs in Bosnia and
        Herzegovina is higher in rural areas, while in general the tendency has been
        for it to decrease during the observed period.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.15847\/cisrnyn.nr14.2020.12","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,5]],"date-time":"2021-03-05T09:35:31Z","timestamp":1614936931000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["National
